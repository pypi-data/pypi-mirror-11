***********************
Developer documentation
***********************

The developer documentation is a collection of notes for Gammapy developers and maintainers.

If something is not covered here, have a look at the very extensive Astropy developer documentation
`here <http://astropy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#developer-documentation>`__,
we do most things the same way.

You shouldn't read all this stuff if you want to contribute something to Gammapy.
Just open an issue or pull request on Github, or ask on the mailing list.
We'll then help you get it done by pointing out where / how to add it and via code review on the pull request
(and linking to relevant sections in the developer docs where relevant).
