=====

The TOSCA Parser can be used as a library by any client program, for example,
OpenStack heat-translator uses it to translate TOSCA to Heat Orchestration
Template (HOT).

For an easy reference on how TOSCA Parser can be used programmatically, refer
to the tosca_parser.py test program which is located at the root level of the
project.
