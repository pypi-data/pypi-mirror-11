        Bugs and issue tracking
        -----------------------
        
        This module should be platform independent, however testing has to
        date only been performed with Windows 8.1 Pro using cmd.exe. Bug
        reports should be submitted via the github issue tracker.
        
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        This module is built for python 3, and is not backwards compatible
        with python 2. 
        
        This module includes a number of functions that provide basic 
        directory browser functionality, in an easy to view format, within a 
        command line environment, e.g. cmd.exe. The display of the directory
        is formatted as follows, where the '..', represents the parent directory: ::
        
        [1] ..
        [2] Folder1
        [3] File1.py
        [4] File2.txt
        [5] Folder2
        Enter a number to select the corresponding directory, or 0 to confirm
        current directory:
        
        Entering the number corresponding to the desired directory changes to that
        directory, providing the browsing funcitonality.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can browse the directory tree by calling browse_dir as follows: ::
        
          from dirbrowser import dirbrowser
          dirbrowser.browse_dir()
        
        The function browse_dir is a wrapper for change_dir that calls another
        function list_children, to create a list of all child items in the
        current directory and display them. change_dir then takes the user input
        and sets the new working directory accordingly.
        
        To display the files within a directory and select a subset (all or one): ::
        
          from dirbrowser import dirbrowser
          dirbrowser.select_files()
        
        The function select_files calls list_children with specific filter
        arguments to show only files, and optionally files of a specific type.
        
        For a full description of these functions run ``help(dirbrowser)``
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Download source package and run ``setup.py install`` or alternativley via
        pip with ``pip3 install dirbrowser --pre``. A binary wheel distribution is also
        available at PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dirbrowser).
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - Add support for selecting subsets of files instead of only all or 1
        - Alter reporting of current directory if path is more than n items to
          display the current path in a more friendly way
