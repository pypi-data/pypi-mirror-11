"""Module that enables basic file/directory browser functionality.

dirbrowser version 1.0b1
========================

This module includes a number of functions that provide basic directory
browser functionality in an easy to view format, within a command
line environment, e.g. the Windows command shell.

For complete documentation see README.rst.

    Children in a directory are stored in a list, which can be filtered
    to contain only files or directories by setting filter_type. Valid
    arguments are:

    None    - Does not filter children. Default option.
    'file'  - Filter only allows files
    'dir'   - Filter only allows directories

    If filter_type is set to "file", the child_list can be additionally
    filtered by the files extension by setting file_filter, which takes
    a string and matches it to the file name. The file_filter argument
    must be a string which matches the file extension, with or without
    the period i.e. both '.txt', and 'txt' are valid arguments.

    NOTE: If no files have a matching extension the resulting child_list
    will be empty.
