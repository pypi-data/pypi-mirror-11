========================

What's new
----------

- Added function to trim paths if they contain more than 7 levels
- Changed browse_dir to return the current working directory (see updated usage)

Bugs and issue tracking
-----------------------

This module should be platform independent, however testing has to
date only been performed with Windows 8.1 Pro using cmd.exe. Bug
reports should be submitted via the github issue tracker.


Description
-----------

This module is built for python 3, and is not backwards compatible
with python 2. 

This module includes a number of functions that provide basic 
directory browser functionality, in an easy to view format, within a 
command line environment, e.g. cmd.exe. The display of the directory
is formatted as follows, where the '..', represents the parent directory: ::

[1] ..
[2] Folder1
[3] File1.py
[4] File2.txt
[5] Folder2
Enter a number to select the corresponding directory, or 0 to confirm
current directory:

Entering the number corresponding to the desired directory changes to that
directory, providing the browsing functionality.

Usage
-----

You can browse the directory tree by calling browse_dir as follows: ::

  from dirbrowser import dirbrowser
  dirbrowser.browse_dir()

The function browse_dir is a wrapper for change_dir that calls another
function list_children, to create a list of all child items in the
current directory and display them. change_dir then takes the user input sets
the new working direcotry, and returns the current working directory on termination.

To display the files within a directory and select a subset (all or one): ::

  from dirbrowser import dirbrowser
  dirbrowser.select_files()

The function select_files calls list_children with specific filter
arguments to show only files, and optionally files of a specific type.

Used in combination, these functions can be used to set directories for
saving and for opening files, and processing a selection of the files: ::

  from dirbrowser import dirbrowser
  origin = os.getcwd()
  # Set save directory
  save_dir = dirbrowser.browse_dir()
  # Reset directory to original location
  os.chdir(origin)
  # Navigate to files to process
  open_dir = dirbrowser.browse_dir()
  files = dirbrowser.select_files()
  for file in files:
      os.chdir(open_dir)
      # Do things to file
      os.chdir(save_dir)
      # Save new file in new location

For a full description of these functions run ``help(dirbrowser)``

Installation
