collective.portlet.fullview
===========================

This is a portlet, which shows a content item with it's default view.

It's inspired by the Plone's full view, therefore the name - and it shares the
same codebase for the ``fullview_item`` view (actually from
collective.fullview/plone.app.contenttypes).

.. note::

    Plone 4 / Archetypes users, if you want to display a content item/folder
    with the full view as default view, please don't use the one provided by
    CMFPlone but use instead the one provided by the ``collective.fullview``
    addon or by ``plone.app.contenttypes``.

    At time of this writing, for plone.app.contenttypes 1.1.x, the fullview is
    provided by the branch ``1.1.x-thet-unifiedlistings``, for 1.2.x the
    fullview is provided with the release ``1.2a6``
