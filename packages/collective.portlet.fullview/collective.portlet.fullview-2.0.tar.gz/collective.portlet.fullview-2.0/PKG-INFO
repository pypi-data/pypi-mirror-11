Description: collective.portlet.fullview
        ===========================
        
        This is a portlet, which shows a content item with it's default view.
        
        It's inspired by the Plone's full view, therefore the name - and it shares the
        same codebase for the ``fullview_item`` view (actually from
        collective.fullview/plone.app.contenttypes).
        
        .. note::
        
            Plone 4 / Archetypes users, if you want to display a content item/folder
            with the full view as default view, please don't use the one provided by
            CMFPlone but use instead the one provided by the ``collective.fullview``
            addon or by ``plone.app.contenttypes``.
        
            At time of this writing, for plone.app.contenttypes 1.1.x, the fullview is
            provided by the branch ``1.1.x-thet-unifiedlistings``, for 1.2.x the
            fullview is provided with the release ``1.2a6``
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0 (2015-07-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Remove plone.memoize instance caches to avoid read on writes.
          [thet]
        
        - Cache the rendered portlet for an hour with sensible cache keys (portlet id,
          path, modification date, user).
          [thet]
        
        - Make the content selection field ``content_uid`` required.
          [thet]
        
        - Don't fail if the portlet was added but no content item can be found.
          [thet]
        
        - Add an ``omit_border`` option to render a div instead of the dl/dt/dd
          structure.
          [datakurre]
        
        - Register the ``RelatedItemsFieldWidget`` adapter for this package's browser
          layer to not conflict with the registration provided in ``plone.app.z3cform``
          in Plone 5.
          [thet]
        
        - Skip portlethash check when it's None for minimal support for
          collective.panels.
          [datakurre]
        
        - Add setuptools entrypoint for Plone.
          [datakurre]
        
        - Fix translation of portlet summary.
          [datakurre]
        
        - Add Finnish localization.
          [datakurre]
        
        - Fix path to uninstall profiles.
          [thet]
        
        - Rename methods, make them properties, use memoize for portlethash.
          [thet]
        
        - Don't call the fullview context object unintended in the templates. This had
          the side effect, of the edit-bar not being rendered.
          [thet]
        
        - Move the content's title into the portlet header.
          [thet]
        
        - Allow fullview portlets to be derived while making sure, they don't run into
          an infinite recursion loop. This is done via annotating the request with the
          portlet hash.
          [thet]
        
        - Return the content object's title for the management screen portlet title to
          better distinguish several portlets.
          [thet]
        
        - Use the ``RelatedItemsFieldWidget`` from ``plone.app.widgets`` and switch to
          a ``z3c.form`` based implementation.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.1 (2015-03-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Only render the fullview portlet, if it's rendered on a context where it is
          directly assigned. Don't render, if it was derived from a parent context.
          This avoids infinite loops when a fullview portlets renders a childitem.
          [thet]
        
        
        1.0 (2015-03-04)
        ----------------
