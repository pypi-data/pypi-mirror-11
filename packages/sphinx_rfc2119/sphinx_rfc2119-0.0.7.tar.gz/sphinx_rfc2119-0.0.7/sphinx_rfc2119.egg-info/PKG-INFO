Description: 
        The purpose of this sphinx extension is enable markup of requirements per the definitions in RFC 2119.
        
         * http://sphinx-doc.org
         * https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt
        
        This is supported by a suite of requirement directives that correspond to the RFC 2119 keywords. There are also a suite of requirement list directives that support documenting reqiurements (that have been defined with the rfc2119 directives).
        
        This module is in ALPHA status. Feedback / pull requests very welcome. Development occurs on GitHub:

        Documentation is a bit strange - I used the directives to document what it is supposed to do. Which was handy as I made it, but probably not very readable.
        
        Basically, add the module to your the conf.py of your repo then use the directives. They have lower case names.
