Description: 
        Uses iTerm2's proprietary escape codes and Imgur to display an image of a cat
        in your terminal.
        
        NOTE: I do not own the images that you see, nor have I any control over
        them. You will see some image that is tagged as "cat" on Imgur. That could be
        anything. We do filter out images that are tagged NSFW, but there are no
        guarantees that you won't see something you wish you hadn't. Use at your own
        risk.
