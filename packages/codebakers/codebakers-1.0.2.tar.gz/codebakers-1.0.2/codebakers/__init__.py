print('''Zen of Codebakers

Empathy wins over code and technical decisions.
Remember the following Kent Beck rules:
    Passes the tests
    Reveals intention
    No duplication
    Fewest elements
Look for an easy deploy in order to deliver faster and better.
If deploy is a problem, increasing delivery is not a solution.
The smaller delivery, the better result is achieved.
Choose the easier option to change later.
Code without tests does not exist. Code with bad tests neither.
Seek to implement relevant tests. Do not trust blind coverage.
Thirdy party component should have integration tests.
Don't take code review as a personal criticism.
Avoid callbacks when it is not the better solution.
Document code whenever you judge it complex.
Don't let the 'maintainer' word give you laziness.
Code in an easy way to understand.
Don't take advantage of obscure properties of tools to solve problems.
