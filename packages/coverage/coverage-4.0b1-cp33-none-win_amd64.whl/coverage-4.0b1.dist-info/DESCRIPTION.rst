Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses
the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard
library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

Coverage.py runs on CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5, PyPy 2.4, and PyPy3 2.4.

Documentation is on `Read the Docs <https://coverage.readthedocs.org/en/coverage-4.0b1>`_.  Code repository and issue
tracker are on `Bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy>`_, with a
mirrored repo on `GitHub <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>`_.

New in 4.0 beta: ``--concurrency``, dropped support for older Pythons,
setup.cfg support, plugins for other file variants, supported data API,
--skip-covered, HTML filtering, and 49 issues closed.
