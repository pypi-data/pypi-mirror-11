Advanced IPv6 Socket Manipulation for Python

Description:

This rather simplistic extension module is intended to allow more advanced
manipulation of IPv6 sockets in Python.  In particular, Python did not have an
easy means to interact with the flow label of a particular IPv6 socket.  This
extension currently allows for flow labels to be enabled on a socket and a
random flow label can be requested from the kernel.  In the future, additional
options may be added to facilitate additional flow label actions.

Installation:

This package is installed using distutils.  The most common approach is to run:

  python setup.py install

Usage:

  import ipv6

You can then pass an ipv6 socket to the function get_flow_label() to
apply a random flow label assigned by the kernel.  The first parameter
is the socket object or the integer file descriptor.  The remaining
parameters are optional depending on the state of your socket.  Here is
an example:

  sockaddr = ipv6.get_flow_label(sock,*sockaddr)

See https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html for info on sockaddr

The get_flow_label call returns a new sockaddr structure with the
flowinfo set the appropriate value.  You can then send data as normal.
