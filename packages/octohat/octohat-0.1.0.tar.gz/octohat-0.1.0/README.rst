It's easy to see your direct `code contributions`_ on GitHub, but what about everything else?

**Octohat** takes a github repo name, and returns a list of every github user that has interacted with a project, but has not committed code. 

Interactions include: 

* raising or commenting on an issue
* raising or commenting on a pull request
* commenting on a commit

"Let's All Build a Hat Rack" (`#LABHR`_) is an original concept by `Leslie Hawthorn`_

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: 

    pip install octohat

Usage
-----
.. code-block:: 

    octohat [-h] [-g] [-l LIMIT] repo_name

    positional arguments:
      repo_name                githubuser/repo

    optional arguments:
      -g, --generate-html      Generate output as HTML
      -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT  Limit to the last x Issues/Pull Requests


Define an environment variable for "GITHUB_TOKEN" to use an `authentication token`_ (allows for deeper searching)


To do
-----
 
* parallel processing
* wiki contributions
* include merge-only contributors as non-code contributors
