Description: # Astro-test
        Capture functions arguments and results and create a unit test file for
        that combination to assist refactoring.
        
        Why?
        Imagine you have to refactor a large, undocumented (untested!) python code base.
        
        This utility captures a functions behaviour by generating test cases during
        test executions of the code.
        
        Why 'Astrotest'?
        ===
        
        'Astroturfing' is a term meaning to create inauthentic comments or discussion
        to influence or overwhelm natural organic debate.
        Hence 'Astro-testing': it's not authentically TDD and it can create
        a large number of test.
