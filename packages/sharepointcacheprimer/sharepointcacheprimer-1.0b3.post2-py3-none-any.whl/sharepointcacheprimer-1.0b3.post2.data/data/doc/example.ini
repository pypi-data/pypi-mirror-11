# Each section is either a site definition or a cookieset definition

#### A Site Definition
# This is a set sharepoint site, with ADFS credentials and an optional
# reference to a cookieset to use.
[example.com]               ; Site: example.com
username = domain\user1     ; ADFS username
password = password1        ; ADFS password
url = http://example.com    ; URL that for site to prime
cookielist = examplecookies ; Optional sectionname for Cookie Sets

#### A Cookieset Definition
# Every line is a cookie
# NAME = value1,value2,valuen
# For each value of each cookie, the site will be primed once. This
# allows a site pool that uses a cookie-based load balancer to force
# iterating through every web frontend via cookies.
# In the below example, the cookie "LB-COOKIE" will be set for each of
# three attempts, using the values abc1, abc2, and abc3 respectively.
#
# If more than one list of cookies is below, that will just be an
# additional iteration. For example, another line with 2 more values
# would cause a total of 5 priming attempts with 5 unique cookie values.
[examplecookies]            ; The label referenced above
LB-COOKIE = abc1,abc2,abc3  ; A cookie list, comma-delimited




#### The same settings as above, without comments:
[example.com]              
username = domain\user1    
password = password1       
url = http://example.com   
cookielist = examplecookies

[examplecookies]           
LB-COOKIE = abc1,abc2,abc3
