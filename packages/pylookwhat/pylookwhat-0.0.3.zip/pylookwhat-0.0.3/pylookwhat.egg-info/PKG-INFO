Description: pylookwhat
        ==========
        
        Sometimes when we need to reference other project's settings to do something, we can use execfile to parse file get variable inside. But a few things can make it difficult:
        
        1. Dependency package(s) are not installed
        2. Relative module(s) not in sys.path
        3. Local module name confused due to scoping. 
        
        Use pylookwhat to solve these
        
        ::
        
            import pylookwhat
        
            what = {}
            lookwhat = [ 'A', 'B'  ]
            filename = 'what.py'
            pylookwhat.lookwhat( filename, what, lookwhat  )
        
            print what
            
            
            
        
        what.py
        
        ::
        
        	A = { "Hello": "World" }
        	B = [ 1, 2, 3 ]

        target.py
        
        ::
        
            A="Hello"
            B=123
        
        
        source.py
