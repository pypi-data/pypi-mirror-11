About
-----

We are an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!



Types of Local Groups
-------------------------

A local group can be:

#. a geographic group: for a city, region, state, or country
#. a student group: for a university, college, or school
#. an interest group: for any topic (e.g. PyGame, SciPy, Django)

The larger the local group, the harder it is to meet in person. Large local group's events will be mostly virtual meetups that occur online, whereas small local group's events tend to be in-person meetups.

A local group can consist of sub-local-groups, making both the in-person and virtual meetups possible.

Group Size
------------

It’s fine if your local group is small. Having just 2-3 women who meet regularly to exchange Python tips and tricks counts as a local group. What matters most is *quality*, not quantity.

Larger local groups have more flexibility to organize different types of events, but it’s harder to get everyone together for dinner.
