        ===========
        
        sphinxserve is a tool to effectively document projects
        ======================================================
        
        `Sphinx`_ is a document processor tool that makes it easy to create intelligent
        and beautiful documentation. The goal of sphinxserve is to make sphinx more
        accessible, interactive, and convenient to use.
        
        
        Design considerations
        =====================
        
        sphinxserve was originally conceived as a Python and Linux project that can
        visualize sphinx document modifications in real time while working on them. At
        its core, sphinxserve uses the awesome `gevent`_ project to provide concurrency
        and event coordination.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        sphinxserve can be installed either as a python package, or as a docker
        application.
        
        Python package
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        System dependencies: python pip xdotool inotify-tools and a browser
        (firefox, chromium, etc).
        
        gevent dependency: An easier way to install gevent (and its greenlet
        dependency) is using wheel packages::
        
            GITHUB="https://github.com/mzdaniel/wheel/raw/master"
            pip install $GITHUB/greenlet-0.4.7-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
            pip install $GITHUB/gevent-1.1b1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
        
        Alternatively, the C development toolchain is needed and used by pip.
        
        sphinxserve (and python dependencies) installation using a wheel from pypi::
        
            pip install sphinxserve
        
        
        Docker application
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `Docker`_ is an extraordinary tool that simplifies the entire dependency tree
        by including it in a system image. This makes the installation experience
        much more pleasant.
        
        System dependencies: docker and a browser
        
        This installation command automatically downloads sphinxserve image and
        creates a small shell script ~/bin/sphinxserve that simplifies the running
        interface::
        
            $ docker run mzdaniel/sphinx install | bash
        
        
        Launching
        =========
        ::
        
            # Assumming your sphinx project is in ~/docproj (containing conf.py),
            # and ~/bin is in your shell $PATH
        
            $ sphinxserve ~/docproj
        
        
        Workflow
        ========
        
        After launching sphinxserve, it looks for a browser, while rebuilds the sphinx
        pages. When it is done, it opens a new tab on the browser pointing to the new
        rendered page. As soon as there is a document change, it automatically
        re-renders the docs and reloads the browser.
