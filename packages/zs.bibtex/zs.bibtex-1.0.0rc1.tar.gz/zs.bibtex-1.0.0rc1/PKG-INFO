        This package for now only includes a quite basic parser for BibTeX which
        converts a bibliography and its entries into simple dict-like data structures
        and also checks crossreferences if used.
        
        .. warning::
        
            The parser does not (and probably never will) support some of the more
            advanced BibTeX-features like preambles.
        
            It also doesn't convert things like accented characters into unicode but
            leaves them as they were in the original input.
        
        A simple example on how to use it::
        
            from zs.bibtex.parser import parse_string
            from StringIO import StringIO
        
            data = '''@article{mm09,
                author = {Max Mustermann},
                title = {The story of my life},
                year = {2009},
                journal = {Life Journale}
            }'''
        
            bibliography = parse_string(data)
            article = bibliography['mm09']
        
        A bibliography as well as each entry in it offers a ``validate()`` method
        which checks aspects like cross-references on the bibliography and fields on
        the entries. It also supports an optional ``raise_unsupported``
        keyword-argument which raises an exception once a possibly unsupported field
        is used in an entry.
        
        The information about what fields are required and optional for what kind of
        entry is based on the `BibTeX article`_ on Wikipedia.
