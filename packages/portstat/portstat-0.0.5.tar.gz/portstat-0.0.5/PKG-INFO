        A simple port traffic monitor
        
        ## Install
        
        ### Install pip
        
        For Debian / Ubunut user
        
        ```
        apt-get update
        apt-get install python-pip
        ```
        
        ### Install portstat
        
        ```
        pip install portstat
        ```
        
        ### System setting
        
        Add the following line to `/etc/rc.local` to run portstat on the startup.
        
        Notice that add it before `exit 0` .
        
        ```
        /sbin/iptables -N PORTSTAT
        /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -j PORTSTAT
        /sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -j PORTSTAT
        /bin/bash /etc/portstat.rules
        ```
        
        To upload the traffic information every minute, we should add the following line in `crontab -e`
        
        ```
        * * * * * /usr/local/bin/portstat -u
        ```
        
        Run it every 5 minutes like the following
        
        ```
        */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/portstat -u
        ```
        
        To activate the new iptables rules, please run the `/sbin/iptables` command manually or issue a `reboot` command.
        
        After that, you have installed portstat successfully.
        
        ## Upgrade
        
        Every new version I will upload it to pypi so that you can upgrade to the latest version with the following code.
        
        ```
        pip install -U portstat
        ```
        
        For some unexpectable reason, I can NOT promise that you can upgrade to the latest version without change your settings.
        
        So, please come back to see what's new at every upgrade.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        usage: portstat [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-v | -s | -u]
        
        A simple port traffic monitor
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                                Path of the config file.
          -v, --version         Show portstat version.
          -s, --sync            Sync the portstat settings and iptables.
          -u, --upload          Upload the port stat with webhook.
        ```
        
        ## Tutorial
        
        First of all, you should install portstat as I mentioned above.
        
        Create a conf in where you like, by default the path is `/etc/portstat.conf`, just remenber use `-c path` to declare the config file if you don't use the default path.
        The conf file should looks like that:
        
        ```
        [imlonghao]
        Port=80
        Webhook=https://imlonghao.com/?imlonghao
        
        [shadowsocks]
        Port=10000-10010
        Webhook=https://imlonghao.com/?shadowsocks
        
        [test]
        Port=22,111,8080
        Webhook=https://imlonghao.com/?test
        ```
        
        `[name]` used to distinguish every port you want to monitor.
         
        `Port=111` used to declare the port you want to monitor, it should be a int like `111` , or a range like `10000-10010`, or `80,81,8080,8888` .
        
        `Webhook=https://imlonghao.com/` used to received the traffic information, portstat will post the information to the webhook like that

        Then, save the config file.
        
        Run `portstat -s` to create new iptables rules to monitor the port you just add.
        
        Run `portstat -u` to upload to port traffic information to webhook manually.
