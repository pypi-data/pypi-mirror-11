Description: 
        Figment
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Figment is a framework for creating multiplayer, text-based worlds. It was
        originally designed to explore the application of the "entity-component-system"
        pattern to the realm of MUDs.
        
        By extending Figment's base classes (particularly ``Component`` and ``Mode``),
        you define the vocabulary unique to your world -- then construct your world's
        people, places, and things using that vocabulary.
        
        While your available vocabulary of Components and Modes cannot yet be changed
        during runtime, they can be dynamically applied to Entities (that's the whole
        point, after all!) so you can even do a good chunk of worldbuilding from within
        the world itself.
