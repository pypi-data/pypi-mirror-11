        Introduction
        ============
        
        What if fuzzy hashing algorithms were usable through a common API,
        the same way that Python's hashlib exposes secure hash and message digest
        algorithms? This is the question fuzzyhashlib attempts to answer by providing
        a hashlib-like interface to:
        
        - ssdeep (via a Python ctypes wrapper)
        - sdbf (via sdhash's Python swig interface)
        
        Currently supported for Python 2.7 on 32- and 64-bit linux (Ubuntu 14.04). 
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Example usage in iPython is provided below.
        
        ::
        
          In [1]: import fuzzyhashlib
          
          In [2]: fuzzyhashlib.ssdeep("a" * 1024).hexdigest()
          Out[2]: '3:tj1:n'
          
          In [3]: fuzzyhashlib.sdhash("a" * 1024).hexdigest()
          Out[3]: 'sdbf:03:0::1024:sha1:256:5:7ff:160:1:0:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==\n'

        ssdeep
        ------
        ssdeep was written by Jesse Kornblum of the ManTech International
        Corporation, with acknowledged contributions by Jason Sherman and
        testing by the Computer Science Department at the University of
        Iowa. Compiled libraries built from unmodified ssdeep source,
        version 2.13, are installed as part of this package. The original
        source code for this version of ssdeep available from:
           http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ssdeep/ssdeep-2.13/ssdeep-2.13.tar.gz
        
        ssdeep is open source software and is licensed under GPLv2.
        
        
        sdhash
        ------
        sdhash was written by Vassil Roussev and Candice Quates. Compiled
        libraries built from unmodified sdhash source, version 3.4, are
        installed are installed as part of this package. The original
        source code for this version of sdhash is available from:

        Other Thanks
        ============
        Thanks to Michael Dorman whose excellent 'yara-ctypes' provided logical layout
        for a Python ctypes-based project. Several concepts and functions here have
        been borrowed accordingly :-)
