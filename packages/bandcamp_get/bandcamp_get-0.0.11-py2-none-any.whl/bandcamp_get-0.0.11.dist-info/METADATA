# bandcamp-get

## automated downloading of bandcamp albums
bandcamp-get uses Selenium WebDriver to automate free album downloads from the music website Bandcamp. By default it creates a temporary email address using Guerrilla Mail, a free throwaway email service. Music sent to the inbox will be downloaded once all albums have been processed, no clicking necessary!

## Installation
* `pip install bandcamp-get`

## Usage
    usage: bandcamp-get [-h] [-b BROWSER] [-e EMAIL] [-v] [USER]

    automated downloading of bandcamp albums

    positional arguments:
      USER                  bandcamp user to download from

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -b BROWSER, --browser BROWSER
                            enter chrome or firefox, defaults to firefox
      -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                            use your own email instead of a throwaway
      -v, --version         display current version

## Notes
* If you choose to use a throwaway email (chosen by default unless --email flag is used), then all emails sent to the throwaway will be opened and the download links followed by the WebDriver. This occurs once all albums have been emailed/otherwise downloaded.

* Closing the bandcamp browser window before all albums have been downloaded is fine if you wish to stop it early! The ones which have been emailed to the throwaway so far will still be downloaded as long as the Guerrilla Mail window is left open.
