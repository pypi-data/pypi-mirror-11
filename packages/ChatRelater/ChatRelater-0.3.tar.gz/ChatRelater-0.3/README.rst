Chat Relater
============

**Chat Relater** is a tool consisting of two command-line scripts:

* The analyzer extracts user relations from chat logs. The gained data
  is serialized as JSON.

* The visualizer takes that data, generates a DOT_ file, and calls the
  GraphViz_ application to render the graph in the requested output
  format (e. g. PDF, PNG, SVG).

It is actually a conceptual clone of the PieSpy_ Social Network Bot.
However, Chat Relater does not act as an IRC bot (although this could be
easily accomplished by making use of the irc_ package), but therefore
allows to be run on any logfiles that produce similar output to those
created by XChat_. Of course, this includes logs from Jabber, SILC or
any other communication (but it might require some minor changes to the
log reader).

The GraphViz_ usage is pretty basic and output may be improved somehow,
but so far, the graphs created by PieSpy_ look **much** nicer.


Requirements
------------

Python_ 2.7+ or 3.3+ is required.

The required Python packages can be installed via pip:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


Tests
-----

To run tests, install the dependencies once, then run tests with tox:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    $ tox


Usage
-----

Run the analyzer on one or more log files, saving the intermediate
results to another file (`chat.json`):

.. code:: sh

    $ ./analyze.py -o chat.json chat_today.log chat_yesterday.log

Create a nice graph (using the 'twopi' program) from the results
(`chat.json`) and save it to a PNG image (`graph.png`):

.. code:: sh

    $ ./visualize.py -f png -p twopi chat.json graph

And intermediate file containing the 'dot' description (`graph`) will be
created in the process.
