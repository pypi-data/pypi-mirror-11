class ImageGenerator():

    This class contains various methods for generating test images

    @staticmethod
    def spheres(shape, radius, porosity):
        r"""
        Generate a packing of overlapping mono-disperse spheres

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : list
            The size of the image to generate in [Nx, Ny, Nz] where N is the
            number of voxels.

        radius : scalar
            The radius of spheres in the packing

        porosity : scalar
            The porosity of the final image.  This number is approximated by
            the method so the returned result may not have exactly the
            specified value.

        Notes
        -----
        This method can also be used to generate a dispersion of hollows by
        treating porosity as solid volume fraction and inverting the returned
        image.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : list
            The size of the image to generate in [Nx, Ny, Nz] where N is the
            number of voxels

        blobiness : scalar
            Controls the morphology of the image.  A higher number results in
            a larger number of smaller blobs.

        porosity : scalar
            The porosity of the final image.  This number is approximated by
