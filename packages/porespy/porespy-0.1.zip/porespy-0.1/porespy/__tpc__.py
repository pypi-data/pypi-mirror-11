class TwoPointCorrelation(object):
    r"""
    Computes the 2-point correlation function of an image

    Examples
    --------
    Generate a test image of a sphere pack:

    >>> import scipy as sp
    >>> import scipy.image as spim
    >>> im = sp.rand(100, 100, 100) < 0.997
    >>> im = spim.distance_transform_edf(im) >= 4

    Import porespy and use it:

    >>> import porespy
    >>> a = porespy.tpc(im)
    >>> vals = a.run(npts=250, spacing=2, rmax=20)

        r"""
        Performs the 2-point correlation calculation.

        This method works by selecting a set of **query** points in the void
        space then finding all neighboring points within a specified distance
        of each **query** point that lie in the void space or the solid phase.
        The fraction of points that lie in the void space as a function of
        distance from the query point is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        npts : int
            The number of points against which the neighboring points should
            be queried.  The **query** points are randomly selected, so
            repeated calls to run will not necessarily generate identical
            results.  If the results differ too much then ``npts`` should be
            incresed.

        r : scalar or vector
            Controls the radial distance from the query points that are
            considered.  If a scalar is received then a list of sizes between
            1 and ``r`` is generated with a spacing of 1 voxel, otherwise the
            given ``r`` values are used.  It is useful to provide ``r`` values
            to limit the number of points and speed-up the calculation.

        TODO: The methods in here could clearly benefit from proper use of
        itertools, nditer, and other numpy functions.  I can't quite figure
        how to convert meshgrid to vector form.
