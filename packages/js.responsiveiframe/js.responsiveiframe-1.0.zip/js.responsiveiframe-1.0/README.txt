js.responsiveiframe
*******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `responsiveiframe`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`responsiveiframe`: http://npr.github.io/responsiveiframe/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.responsiveiframe``) are published to some URL.
