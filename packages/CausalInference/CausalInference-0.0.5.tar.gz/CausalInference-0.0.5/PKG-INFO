Description: CausalInference
        ===============
        
        CausalInference is a Python implementation of statistical and econometric methods in the field variously known as Causal Inference, Program Evaluation, and Treatment Effect Analysis.
        
        Work on CausalInference started in 2014 by Laurence Wong as a personal side project. It is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

        Main Features
        =============
        
        * Assessment of overlap in covariate distributions
        * Estimation of propensity score
        * Improvement of covariate balance through trimming
        * Subclassification on propensity score
        * Estimation of treatment effects via matching, blocking, weighting, and least squares
        
        Dependencies
