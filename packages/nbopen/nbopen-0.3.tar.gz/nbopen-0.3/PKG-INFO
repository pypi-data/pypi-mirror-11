Description: Open notebooks from the command line
        
        nbopen looks for the nearest running notebook server - if it finds one, it
        opens a web browser to that notebook. If not, it starts a new notebook server
        in that directory.
        
        Installation::
        
            pip install nbopen
        
        Usage::
        
            nbopen AwesomeNotebook.ipynb
        
        To integrate with your file manager, so you can double click on notebooks
        to open them, clone the repository and run:
        
        * Linux/BSD: ``./xdg-install.sh``.
        * Windows: ``python win-install.py``
        * Mac: ``./osx-install.sh``
