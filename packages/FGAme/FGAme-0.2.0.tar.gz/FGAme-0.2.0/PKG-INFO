Description: A game engine for 2D physics. FGAme was developed for a course on computer
        games physics. Simplicity and ease to use were valued more than raw performance
        and fancy graphics.
        
        Main features:
          * AABB's, Circle and Convex Polygons collisions.
          * Backend agnostic (Pygame and sdl2 are supported, for now).
