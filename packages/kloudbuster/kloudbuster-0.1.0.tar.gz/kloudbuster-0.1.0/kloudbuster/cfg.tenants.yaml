# KloudBuster tenant and users files
# Usage: Pass to KloudBuster using "-l"
#
# This file contains the a list of tenants and users that will be reused by
# KloudBuster instead of creating them. This is useful when running
# KloudBuster on clouds without admin permissions.
#
# Settings in this file has higher priority than user configs. It determines
# the final count of tenants and useres that KloudBuster will use.
#
# If running under tenant/user reusing mode, KloudBuster will use *only* one
# tenant to hold the resources for both server cloud and client cloud.
#
# NOTE:
# (1) For now, we only support one user per tenant;
# (2) Under tenant/user resuing mode, all resources will be sitting under
#     the same tenant, so there will be fixed *ONLY* one user for holding
#     client side resources;
