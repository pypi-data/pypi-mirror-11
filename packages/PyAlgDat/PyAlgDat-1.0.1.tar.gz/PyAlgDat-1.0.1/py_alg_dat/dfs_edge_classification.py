"""
Provides functionality to perform edge classification
of directed -and undirected graphs. The edges are
traversed in a depth-first search and classified into
four edge types: tree edge, back edge, forward edge,
or cross edge. During execution of the depth-first
search, the classifiction of edge (u, v), the edge
from vertex u to vertex v, depends on whether v has
been visited before during the depth-first search and
if so, the relationship between u and v.

NOTE:
Edge classification in directed graphs is different
from edge classification in undirected graphs. In a
directed graph an edge is classified into one of the
the four types mentioned above. An undirected graph
cannot contain forward edges and cross edges, since
in those cases, the edge (u, v) would already have
been traversed during depth-first search before
vertex u is reached and depth-first search tries to
visit vertex v.
