ABOUT PYALGDAT
==============
PyAlgDat is a collection of data structures and algorithms written in Python.
The purpose of the code is to show how many of the abstract data types (ADTs) and
algorithms being thought in Computer Science courses can be realised in Python.

My primary focus has been to write a library which presents a clear
implementation of the various data structures and algorithms and how they can
be used. This means that I have made a conscious tradeoff where clarity of the
code outweighs subtle and exotic implementation constructs.

The library has mostly been implemented as a recreational project and should
as such not be used in production code, since most of the data structures and
algorithms are already available in the standard Python library. However,
writing software that is robust, performs well, and is easy to maintain requires
knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Therefore, implementing and
experimenting with these provides valuable knowledge about the inner workings
and implementation details found in such standard libraries.

FEATURES
========
Data structures included in the library

+ Dynamic array
+ Stack
+ Queue
+ BinaryHeap

   - MinHeap
   - MaxHeap

+ LinkedList

   - Singly linked list
   - Doubly linked list

+ Partition/Union-Find
+ Graph
   - Directed
   - Undirected 
   - Directed weighted
   - Undirected weighted

Additionally, the library contains the most common algorithms and operations
needed when working with these data structures.

REQUIREMENTS
============
The library is selfcontained and does not have any external dependencies.
PyAlgDat should run on any platform with Python 2.7 or above.

INSTALLATION
============
The package can be installed using `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install PyAlgDat

EXAMPLES
========
PyAlgDat has a collection of functional test examples which shows how the
library can be used from a client's perspective.

Dijkstra's algorithm.
