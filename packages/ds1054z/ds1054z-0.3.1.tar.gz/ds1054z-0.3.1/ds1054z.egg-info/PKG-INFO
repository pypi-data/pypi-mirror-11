Description: ds1054z
        =======
        
        This package allows you to connect to your Rigol DS1054Z oscilloscope
        via Ethernet. It comes with a versatile command line tool.
        
        Off course, you can also to control the scope with your own script by
        using `the
        APIs <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/index.html>`__ this
        package has to offer.
        
        While this software is named after the entry level oscilloscope DS1054Z,
        there is no reason to believe it wouldn't also work with just any scope
        of the MSO1000Z and DS1000Z series by Rigol:
        
        -  MSO1104Z-S
        -  MSO1074Z-S
        -  MSO1104Z
        -  MSO1074Z
        -  DS1104Z-S Plus
        -  DS1074Z-S Plus
        -  DS1104Z Plus
        -  DS1074Z Plus
        -  DS1054Z
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The installation is dead simple:
        
        ::
        
            pip install ds1054z[savescreen,discovery]
        
        ds1054z depends on
        `python-vxi11 <https://github.com/python-ivi/python-vxi11>`__ which
        should automatically get installed along with itself.
        
        For more information on the installation, please consult the
        `installation
        section <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installation.html>`__
        of the `package
        documentation <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/index.html>`__.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Discovering your scope via mDNS / DNS-SD
        -  Saving Screenshots (incl. adjustable dimming of on-screen controls)
        -  Running / stopping the scope
        -  Acquiring waveforms
        -  ... more to come!
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Command Line Tool
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This package installs a versatile command line (CLI) tool called
        ``ds1054z``. You can use it to save the screen of your scope, for
        example:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ds1054z save-screen --overlay 0.6 192.168.0.23
        
        As a result, a file like this will be saved to your current working
        directory:
        
        .. figure:: docs/images/ds1054z-scope-display.png
           :alt: oscilloscope screenshot
        
           oscilloscope screenshot
        
        Find out more ways to use the CLI tool with ``ds1054z --help``

        If you're into Python programming, use `the DS1054Z
        class <https://ds1054z.readthedocs.org/en/stable/api/ds1054z.html>`__ in
        your own code:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from ds1054z import DS1054Z
        
            scope = DS1054Z('192.168.0.23')
            print("Connected to: ", scope.idn)
        
            print("Currently displayed channels: ", str(scope.displayed_channels))
