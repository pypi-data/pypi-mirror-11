Installation
------------

GameFaqsPY is conveniently available via pip:

::

    pip install gamefaqs-py

or installable via ``git clone`` and ``setup.py``

::

    git clone https://github.com/ryantonini/gamefaqs-py
    sudo python setup.py install

The application now supports database access.  The new access system runs queries with speed and efficiency.  To use the database system, run the following script upon installation:

::


    python /path/to/run_load.py

The script will create a SQLite database file in the current working directory containing data loaded from http://www.gamefaqs.com/.

NOTE: Currently, the database contains minimal game support.  Updates are pending.
