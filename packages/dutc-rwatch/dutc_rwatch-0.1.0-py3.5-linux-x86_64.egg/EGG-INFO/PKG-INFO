        # Compatibility
        
        * Python 3.5 or higher
        * Linux or OS X
        * need build toolchain (prob. need `gcc`)
        
        # Read Watches in Python
        
        ```python
        >>> import rwatch # enable functionality
        >>> from sys import setrwatch, getrwatch
        >>> x, y, z = object(), object(), object()
        >>> def view(frame, obj):
        ...     print(frame, obj)
        ...     return obj
        ...
        >>> setrwatch({id(x): view, id(y): view})
        >>> getrwatch()
        {139825758638208: <function view at 0x7f2bb89a59d8>, 139825758638224: <function view at 0x7f2bb89a59d8>}
        >>> x
        <frame object at 0x7f2bb8ad9ba8> <object object at 0x7f2bb8ac9080>
        <object object at 0x7f2bb8ac9080>
        >>> y
        <frame object at 0x7f2bb8ad9d48> <object object at 0x7f2bb8ac9090>
        <object object at 0x7f2bb8ac9090>
        >>> z
        <object object at 0x7f2bb8ac90a0>
        ```
        # Lessons:
         * read watches are a very useful tool for debugging
         * it's actually very useful for a language to have a runtime
         * there are some hidden equivalencies between, e.g., read watches and perfect proxy objects
