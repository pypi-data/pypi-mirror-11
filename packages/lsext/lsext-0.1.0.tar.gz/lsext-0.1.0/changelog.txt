0.1.6 -- 1 May 2015
1. Adapted the unpythonic code.


0.1.5 -- 23 Mar 2015
1. Removed the function, `remove_items',
   thus making it more unpythonic.

   Buggy!
   Undebuggable!
   Illegible!

   Just for fun or challenge.  ^_^

   Consider pythonizing it next time.


0.1.4 -- Mar 11, 2015
1. Added `-i' option, used to ignore the specified directory
name, e.g. .git.

2. `argparse' is too verbose!
   Consider wrapping it into a function.
   Or, wrapping the whole module to make a concise one.

3. What a bad programmer!
   What a mess!
   `operate_all_files'.

4. From now on, use git for version controlling,
   not merely for transferring data between github
   and my local computer.


0.1.3 -- Feb 21, 2015
1. Employed str.lower since `.pdf' and `.PDF'
should be the regarded as the same extension.
And assumed that all extensions' cases should be insignificant.

2. Changed function names: `compose_function'
to `fcompose', `map_function' to `fmap'.


0.1.1 -- Feb 20, 2015
1. Completed the refactoring in the core function,
`get_all_info'.


0.1.1pre -- Feb 19, 2015
1. Changed to returning chained generators,
instead of a list reduced from a list of lists;
in the the core function `get_all_info'.

2. Please refactor the core function `get_all_info',
such that, you can just collect the information
specified by the extracting function
which is provided as one of the arguments to `get_all_info'.
But now i am too exhausted. i have to sleep.
Let's fix it tomorrow.

3. Happy chinese new year! am i a hard-working
and responsible employee,
one who still keeps coding to deep night
even in the new year's day.


0.1.0 -- Feb 14, 2015
1. Rewritten from scratch, using os.walk
instead of using recursive os.listdir.

2. Added size and number distribution analysis.

3. Likely to add the feature of recognizing files
based upon their magic numbers rather than the suffixes.
Obviously, this feature will cost more time.
