Prerequisites
=============

PyKayacIM is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.x. It was tested on
CPython (i.e. the regular python) 2.7.10 and 3.4.3.

The package `Python-Future <http://python-future.org/>`_ is required by
PyKayacIM. Execute ``pip install future`` to install this package using
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_.

.. note:: To use PyKayacIM on Python <2.7 additional packages such
   as `argparse <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse>`_ may be
   necessary.

To make use of PyKayacIM you should have a valid im.kayac.com account. To
activate one, access the website `im.kayac.com <http://im.kayac.com/en/>`_
(in English) or `its Japanese version <http://im.kayac.com/ja/>`_, and
follow the instructions.
