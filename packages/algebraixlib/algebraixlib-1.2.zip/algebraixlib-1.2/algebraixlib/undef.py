r"""Facilities for representing and working with the concept of "undefined".

Most operations are not defined for all types of data: :term:`set` operations may not be defined on
:term:`couplet`\s, :term:`multiset` operations may not be defined on sets, and so on. When an
operation is not defined for a given input, it returns the singleton `Undef()`. This return value
can then be taken into account by the caller. In some cases it is an error, in other cases the
result is simply ignored.
