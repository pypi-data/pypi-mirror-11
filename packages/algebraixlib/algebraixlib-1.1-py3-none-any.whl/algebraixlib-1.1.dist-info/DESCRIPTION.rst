algebraixlib
============

What Is It?
-----------
``algebraixlib`` is a library that provides constructs and facilities to harness the fundamentals
of data algebra.

Requirements
------------
`Python`_  3.4.3 or later.
`IPython Notebook`_ 3.2 or later for the IPython notebook tutorials and examples.

How to Install
--------------
If you already have Python installed and are familiar with installing packages, you can get
``algebraixlib`` with ``pip``::

> pip install algebraixlib

Additional user permissions may be necessary to complete the installation. In such a situation
other options include installing the package to the home directory::

> pip install algebraixlib --user <username> 

or in a virtual environment, see `Creation of virtual environments`_.

You can also manually download ``algebraixlib`` from `GitHub`_ or `PyPI`_. To install from a
download, unpack it and run the following from the top-level source directory using the terminal::

> python setup.py install

Unit Tests
----------
The unit tests require the following libraries be installed:

*   `nose`_
*   `coverage`_

To execute the unit tests, from the console, in the algebraixlib directory, use the command::

> python runtests.py

Document Build
--------------
