r"""This package contains modules that represent :term:`algebra`\s and their operations.

To the mathematical operations of a given algebra, we also add:

-   Functions that return metadata. (For example, all our algebras contain an ``is_member``
    function that returns ``True`` if the argument is a member of the given algebra's :term:`ground
    set`. This function is not mathematically an operation of the algebra.)
-   Other functions that are mathematically related, but have arguments or return results that are
    not members of the ground set. (For example, the :func:`~.relations.get_lefts` function of the
    :term:`algebra of relations` returns a result that is not an element of the algebra's ground
    set.)

The algebras based on :term:`set`\s that are provided are:

-   :mod:`~.sets`: The :term:`algebra of sets`.
-   :mod:`~.couplets`: The :term:`algebra of couplets`.
-   :mod:`~.relations`: The :term:`algebra of relations`.
-   :mod:`~.clans`: The :term:`algebra of clans`.

The algebras based on :term:`multiset`\s that are provided are:

-   :mod:`~.multisets`: The :term:`algebra of multisets`.
-   :mod:`~.multiclans`: The :term:`algebra of multiclans`.
