    Attributes
    ----------
    name : Str
        The operation name.  Used to name the new metadata field in the
        experiment that's created by apply()
        
    channel : Str
        The name of the channel to apply the range gate.
        
    low : Float
        The lowest value to include in this gate.
        
    high : Float
        The highest value to include in this gate.
