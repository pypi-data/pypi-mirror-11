Description: Typesys
        =======
        
        
        Intro
        -----
        
        Typesys is a module that is meant to make it more easy to manage types.
        It contains three decorators; type_hints, type_corrector, and return_type.
        
        The type_hints decorator lets the user specify what the arguements of
        a functions should be. If arguments of another type than specified in the
        decorator are passed in, a TypeError will be raised.
        
        The type_corrector decorator lets the user specify what types the 
        arguments to a function should have, but not necessarily are passed in as,
        which means it allows some margin of error. It's not 100% safe to use as it
        still might result in a ValueError or TypeError if the user isn't careful enough.
        
        The return_type decorator lets the user specify what type the decoratred
        function should return. A TypeError will be raised if the function tries to 
        return a value of another type. 
        
        The motivation behing this module was to abstract some of the type checking and
        type casting to a higher level. I wanted to find a way that makes it easier
        for the programmer to see what types the arguments should be, what a type
        a function should return, and at the same time allow some margin of error (in
        case of type_corrector).
        I'm not sure whether this is a good idea or not, or if it's a good approach.
        It was mostly developed for fun while playing around with decorators.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        pip install typesys
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First import the decorators from the typesys module:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from typesys import type_hints, type_corrector, return_type
        
        Then you are ready to start decorating your functions.
        
        type_hints
        ''''''''''
        
        Decorate your functions with the types you want the arguments to be, as shown in
        the examples below
        
        .. code:: python
            
            # a and b must be integers
            @type_hints(int, int)
            def add(a, b):
                return a+b
        
        
            # also work with default arguments
            @type_hints(int, float)
            def add(a, b=0.0):
                return a+b
        
        
            # accepts both integers and floats as arguments
            @type_hints(int, float)
            def mult(*numbers):
                result = 1
                for num in numbers:
                    result *= num
                return result
        
        
            # Only accept integer arguments
            @type_hints(int)
            def mult(**kwargs):
                x = kwargs.get('x')
                y = kwargs.get('y')
                z = kwargs.get('z')    
                return x * y * z
        
        
          
        type_corrector
        ''''''''''''''
        
        Decorate your functions with the types you want the arguments to be treated as, 
        but not necessarily are passed in as, as shown in the examples below.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            @type_corrector(int, int)
            def add(x,y):
                return x+y
        
            
            @type_corrector(float, float)
            def div(x,y):
                return x/y
               
        
        A call to add(1,'2') will cast '2' to an int, since that is what we
        specified as the type of the second paramater in the decorator.
        We can also call div as div('10', '3'), and div will return 3.3333333333333335
        as expected.
        
        This decorator also works with \*args and \*\*kwargs
        
        .. code:: python
        
            @type_corrector(int)
            def mult(*numbers):
                result = 1
                for num in numbers:
                    result *= num
                return result
        
        
            @type_corrector(int)
            def kw_mult(**kwargs):
                x = kwargs.get('x')
                y = kwargs.get('y')
                z = kwargs.get('z')
                return x * y * z
        
        
        This allows us to call the functions like this:
        
        - mult(2, '3', '4') 
        - kw_mult(x=2, y='3', z='4')
        
        When looking at the function definitions of add, mult and kw_mult we can easily
        see that the arguments are supposed to be integers.
        By decorating the functions like this it should also be a clear
        hint what types we want the arguments to be passed in as, even though it 
        allows some margin of error.
        
        
        return_type
        '''''''''''
        
        Decorate your functions with the type or types you want your functions to
        return, as shown in the examples below.
        
        .. code:: python
            
            # accepts both integers, float and complex numbers
            # to be returned
            @return_type(int, float, complex)
            def add(x,y):
                return x+y
        
        
            # only accept integers to be returned
            @return_type(int)
            def strict_add(x,y):
                return x+y
        
        Known issues
        ------------
        
        - When calling help on a decorated function the parameters are not shown
          correctly, instead it will just say <function name>(\*args, \*\*kwargs).
          Thanks to the functools.wraps decorator the docstring of a decorated function
          will still be shown correctly.
        - When using the inspect module to get the argument specification with
          inspect.getargspec or getting the source code from inspect.getsourcelines
          it will fail and show the wrapped function instead.
