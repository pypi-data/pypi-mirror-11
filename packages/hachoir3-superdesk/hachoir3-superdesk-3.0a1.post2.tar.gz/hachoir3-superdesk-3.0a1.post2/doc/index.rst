Welcome to Hachoir's documentation!
===================================

*Hachoir* is a Python library to view and edit a binary stream field by field.
In other words, Hachoir allows you to "browse" any binary stream just like you
browse directories and files. A file is splitted in a tree of fields, where the
smallest field is just one bit. Examples of fields types: integers,
strings, bits, padding types, floats, etc. Hachoir is the French word for a
meat grinder (meat mincer), which is used by butchers to divide meat into long
tubes; Hachoir is used by computer butchers to divide binary files into fields.
