Simple Django app that allows insertion of inline media in text fields. Based on django-basic-apps/inlines, comes with two models, Picture and PictureSet, uses sorl.thumbnail, django-tagging, and the jquery plugin prettyPhoto. It also handles the insertImage command of Wysihtml5. See it in action running the demo projects.
