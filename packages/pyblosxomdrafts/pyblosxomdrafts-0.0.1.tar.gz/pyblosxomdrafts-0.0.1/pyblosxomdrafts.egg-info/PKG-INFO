Description: # pyblosxomdrafts
        
        A [PyBlosxom](https://pyblosxom.github.io/) plugin that lets you save draft
        blog entries.
        
        Any entries with a "drafts" folder anywhere in their path are considered drafts.
        For example:
        
            entries/drafts/my-draft-post.txt
            entries/category/sub-category/drafts/another-draft-post.txt
        
        Drafts will be filtered out from all index pages, such as the front page of
        your blog, category pages, and feeds. But if you visit a draft's permalink
        page (e.g. `/drafts/my-draft-post`) directly in your browser, then you'll see
        the draft post rendered.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the pyblosxomdrafts package from pip:
        
            pip install pyblosxomdrafts
        
        Then add it to the `load_plugins` setting in your `config.py`:
