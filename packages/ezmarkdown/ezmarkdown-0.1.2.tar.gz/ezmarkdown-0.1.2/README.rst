ezmarkdown
==========

**ezmarkdown** stands for easy MarkDown.

| `MarkDown`_ is a convenient way to write formatted documents.
| It was created with the goal of enabling people to “to write using an
  easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert
  it to structurally valid HTML”.
| See `this cheatsheet`_.

This module enables to write MarkDown in an IPython notebook and export
some or all the cells in the notebook as a standalone HTML document.

| The export module uses nbconvert.
| Several export templates are available:
| * Output cells only
| * Input cells only
| * Input and output cells
| * Output cells with toggle input cells
| * Input cells with toggle output cells
