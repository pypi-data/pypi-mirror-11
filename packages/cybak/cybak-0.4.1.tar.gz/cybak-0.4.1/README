At first use, run the included "setup.py" script. This can be done by running:

root@example: ~ > python /path/to/setup.py

with root priveleges. The script will install the lzma compression utility for
Ubuntu. This utility has only been tested in Ubuntu.

To use the utility, simply run:

root@example: ~ > python /path/to/backup-lzma.py

with root priveleges.

Options can be changed in the configuration file, aptly named "CONFIG.txt".
