        **********
        
        A package that defines the site policy of a PloneScholarlyJournal
        site.
        
        `sources <https://github.com/ulif/psj.policy>`_ | `issues <https://github.com/ulif/psj.policy/issues>`_
        
        The ``Plone Scholarly Journal`` (PSJ) is a collection of packages to
        create and maintain scientific scholarly journals using Plone.
        
        The special abilities of PSJ are:
        
        - High quality on-the-fly transformations of office documents using
          OpenOffice/LibreOffice.
        
        - Flexible metadata handling
        
        This package contains the transforms to generate HTML and PDF docs
        from input files in office formats (``.doc``, ``.docx``, LibreOffice
        docs).
        
        Currently, the whole thing consists of three packages:
        
        - ``psj.content`` (provides specialized content types with extended
          metadata handling)
        
        - ``psj.policy`` (this package)
        
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You need the following things to install this package:
        
        - **Python 2.6 or 2.7**
        
          Currently Python 2.6 or 2.7 is needed to run Zope (Plone and
          psj). Python 2.7 is recommended.
        
          The package also requires libxml2-dev and libxslt-dev to compile the
          Python lxml package.
        
          Debian/Ubuntu users can install it via::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
        
        - **git**
        
          `git` is needed to fetch development packages of `ulif.openoffice`
          that are not released already.
        
          Debian/Ubuntu users can install it via::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install git
        
        - **libxml, libxslt**
        
          `libxml2` and `libxslt` are required for `lxml` support required by
          this package. The development versions of this packages are needed
          to have access to the respective header files.
        
          Debian/Ubuntu users can install them via::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First, make sure your system meets the requirements mentioned above.
        
        
        Using `zc.buildout`
        -------------------
        
        We use `zc.buildout` to build a runnable, testable `psj` environment.
        
        Bootstrap the initial buildout environment::
        
            $ python2.7 bootstrap.py -v 1.7.1
        
        and run the buildout command::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Lots of stuff will be downloaded, compiled and installed here.
        
        If you happen to change the values in `buildout.cfg`, you have to
        'rebuild' the environment by running ``bin/buildout`` again.
        
        You can run the tests using something like::
        
            $ bin/test
        
        
        Using Python-eggs
        -----------------
        
        If you use `psj.policy` as part of another package, you can simply
        install it using `pip` and the Python Package Index (PyPI).::
        
            $ pip install psj.policy
        
        which will install the latest released version. If you have psj.policy
        already installed, you can update using::
        
            $ pip install -U psj.policy

        Changelog
        *********
        
        1.1 (2015-09-04)
        ================
        
        * Removed outdated scripts.
        
        * The `psj_html` processor now delivers unprettified HTML output.
          This can avoid gaps in rendered HTML output.
        
        * Added MANIFEST.in to also package .txt files in docs/. Thanks
          to Dieter Maurer for the hint!
        
        
        1.0 (2015-07-16)
        =====================
        
        * Use `ulif.openoffice` 1.1 from now on.
        
        * Major rewrite to become compatible with Plone 4.x
        
        * Moved module root from `src` to egg root.
        
        
        0.3 (2013-08-02)
        ================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Removed ``oooctl``, ``convert`` scripts. They are now maintained in
          a separate package `ulif.openoffice` (which needs to be
          installed). This is more reliable in that a locally installed
          OpenOffice.org suite (as provided by dists like Ubuntu) can be used.
        
          We now also have a distinct interface to communicate with an
          OpenOffice.org server.
        
        * Changed OpenOffice.org transforms to use new ulif.openoffice
          package for document conversion.
        
        * Added .docx transformations. We can now also convert .docx files to
          .pdf and HTML.
        
        * Added conditional registering of mime-type for .docx files and icon.
        
        
        0.2.1 (2008-12-09)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Fix broken download URL for OpenOffice.org in buildout.
        
        * Add version information for ``GenericSetup``.
        
        
        0.2 (2008-12-09)
        ================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Fixed race condition or whatever, that stopped the conversion from
          working with ``Products.LinguaPlone`` package.
        
        * Enabled XHTML-1.0 output instead of HTML.
        
        * Improved transform initialization to cope with already installed
          transforms of same names. Those are now unregistered first.
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Added support for MS word documents.
        
        * Added tidy call for generating XHTML from HTML
        
        * Added script for preparing/restoring libs (UN*X only).
        
        
        0.1.1 (2008-03-22)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Pinned down plone version: > 3.0 < 3.1dev.
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Added start/stop scripts for OOo server (UN*X only).
        
        * Added standalone converter that uses OOo in background.
        
        * Added openoffice buildout recipe.
        
        * Added PILwoTK in buildout. This is a PIL package that really works
          with buildout.
        
        
        0.1 (2008-03-06)
        ================
        
        * Initial release
