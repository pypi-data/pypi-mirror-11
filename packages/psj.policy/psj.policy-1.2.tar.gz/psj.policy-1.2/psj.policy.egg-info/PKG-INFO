Description: psj.policy
        **********
        
        A package that defines the site policy of a PloneScholarlyJournal
        site.
        
        `sources <https://github.com/ulif/psj.policy>`_ | `issues <https://github.com/ulif/psj.policy/issues>`_
        
        The ``Plone Scholarly Journal`` (PSJ) is a collection of packages to
        create and maintain scientific scholarly journals using Plone.
        
        The special abilities of PSJ are:
        
        - High quality on-the-fly transformations of office documents using
          OpenOffice/LibreOffice.
        
        - Flexible metadata handling
        
        This package contains the transforms to generate HTML and PDF docs
        from input files in office formats (``.doc``, ``.docx``, LibreOffice
        docs).
        
        Currently, the whole thing consists of three packages:
        
        - ``psj.content`` (provides specialized content types with extended
          metadata handling)
        
        - ``psj.policy`` (this package)
        
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You need the following things to install this package:
        
        - **Python 2.6 or 2.7**
        
          Currently Python 2.6 or 2.7 is needed to run Zope (Plone and
          psj). Python 2.7 is recommended.
        
          The package also requires libxml2-dev and libxslt-dev to compile the
          Python lxml package.
        
          Debian/Ubuntu users can install it via::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
        
        - **git**
        
          `git` is needed to fetch development packages of `ulif.openoffice`
          that are not released already.
        
          Debian/Ubuntu users can install it via::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install git
        
        - **libxml, libxslt, zlib**
        
          `libxml2`, `libxslt`, and the `zlib` compression library are
          required for `lxml` support required by this package. The
          development versions of this packages are needed to have access to
          the respective header files.
        
          Debian/Ubuntu users can install them via::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev zlib1g-dev
        
          (tested on Ubuntu 14.04.2)
        
        - **unoconv, tidy**
        
          `unoconv` is the commandline tool we use for transforms behind the
          scene. Strictly speaking it is not required (everything will install
          without it), but if you want any transforms, you will need it.
        
          `tidy` is also a commandline helper. It is needed for cleaning up
          HTML code. Not strictly required, but you will need it if you want
          flawless workflows.
        
          Debian/Ubuntu users can install these tools via::
        
            $ sudo apt-get install unoconv tidy
        
          (tested on Ubuntu 14.04.2)
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First, make sure your system meets the requirements mentioned above.
        
        
        Using `zc.buildout`
        -------------------
        
        We use `zc.buildout` to build a runnable, testable `psj` environment.
        
        As first step we get the sources from github and change to the newly
        created dir::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/ulif/psj.policy
            $ cd psj.policy
        
        Bootstrap the initial buildout environment::
        
            $ python2.7 bootstrap.py -v 1.7.1
        
        and run the buildout command::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Lots of stuff will be downloaded, compiled and installed here.
        
        If you happen to change the values in `buildout.cfg`, you have to
        'rebuild' the environment by running ``bin/buildout`` again.
        
        You can run the tests using something like::
        
            $ bin/test
        
        
        Using Python-eggs
        -----------------
        
        If you use `psj.policy` as part of another package, you can simply
        install it using `pip` and the Python Package Index (PyPI).::
        
            $ pip install psj.policy
        
        which will install the latest released version. If you have psj.policy
        already installed, you can update using::
        
            $ pip install -U psj.policy

        Many thanks to all these institutions and persons!
        
        
        Changelog
        *********
        
        1.2 (2015-09-12)
        ================
        
        * Fix overwriting of subobjects during transforms.
        
        * Removed dependency from `restclient`.
        
        * Do not set `output_encoding` of transformed PDF docs.
        
        
        1.1 (2015-09-04)
        ================
        
        * Removed outdated scripts.
        
        * The `psj_html` processor now delivers unprettified HTML output.
          This can avoid gaps in rendered HTML output.
        
        * Added MANIFEST.in to also package .txt files in docs/. Thanks
          to Dieter Maurer for the hint!
        
        
        1.0 (2015-07-16)
        =====================
        
        * Use `ulif.openoffice` 1.1 from now on.
        
        * Major rewrite to become compatible with Plone 4.x
        
        * Moved module root from `src` to egg root.
        
        
        0.3 (2013-08-02)
        ================
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Removed ``oooctl``, ``convert`` scripts. They are now maintained in
          a separate package `ulif.openoffice` (which needs to be
          installed). This is more reliable in that a locally installed
          OpenOffice.org suite (as provided by dists like Ubuntu) can be used.
        
          We now also have a distinct interface to communicate with an
          OpenOffice.org server.
        
        * Changed OpenOffice.org transforms to use new ulif.openoffice
          package for document conversion.
        
        * Added .docx transformations. We can now also convert .docx files to
          .pdf and HTML.
        
        * Added conditional registering of mime-type for .docx files and icon.
        
        
        0.2.1 (2008-12-09)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Fix broken download URL for OpenOffice.org in buildout.
        
        * Add version information for ``GenericSetup``.
        
        
        0.2 (2008-12-09)
        ================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Fixed race condition or whatever, that stopped the conversion from
          working with ``Products.LinguaPlone`` package.
        
        * Enabled XHTML-1.0 output instead of HTML.
        
        * Improved transform initialization to cope with already installed
          transforms of same names. Those are now unregistered first.
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Added support for MS word documents.
        
        * Added tidy call for generating XHTML from HTML
        
        * Added script for preparing/restoring libs (UN*X only).
        
        
        0.1.1 (2008-03-22)
        ==================
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        * Pinned down plone version: > 3.0 < 3.1dev.
        
        Feature changes
        ---------------
        
        * Added start/stop scripts for OOo server (UN*X only).
        
        * Added standalone converter that uses OOo in background.
        
        * Added openoffice buildout recipe.
        
        * Added PILwoTK in buildout. This is a PIL package that really works
          with buildout.
        
        
        0.1 (2008-03-06)
        ================
        
        * Initial release
