"""
Module that defines all the objects required to handle polymorphic
collection read requests.

Only ES-based models that have collection view registered are handled
by this module.

Im particular:
    * PolymorphicACL: Dynamic factory class that generates ACL considering
        ACLs of all the collections requested.
    * PolymorphicESView: View that handles polymorphic collection read
        requests.
    * add_url_polymorphic: Wrapper class that is used instead of default
        `nefertari.wrappers.add_object_url`.

To use this module, simply include it in your `main()` after
Pyramid ACLAuthorizationPolicy is set up and nefertari is included.

By default this module is included by 'nefertari.elasticsearch' when
`elasticsearch.enable_polymorphic_query` setting is True.

After inclusion, PolymorphicESView view will be registered to handle GET
requests. To access polymorphic API endpoint, compose URL with names
used to access collection GET API endpoints.

E.g. If API had collection endpoints '/users' and '/stories', polymorphic
endpoint would be available at '/users,stories' and '/stories,users'.

Polymorphic endpoints support all the read functionality regular ES
endpoint supports: query, search, filter, sort, aggregation, etc.
