        =================
        
        A Django app that provides template tags to easily incorporate smartmenus (http://www.smartmenus.org/).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To get started using ``django-smartmenus``:
        
        - install it with ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install django-smartmenus
        
        - add the app to ``INSTALLED_APPS``. If you are using Django CMS, make sure it's before ``menus``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django_smartmenus',
                'menus', #Only if you are using Django CMS
                ...
            )
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The best way to see how it works is exploring the example project. But for the impatient, all you need to do is:
        
        - load smartmenus tags in the templates::
        
        	{% load smartmenus_tags %}
        
        
        - Call smartmenus template tags where css and js files should show::
        
        	{% smartmenus_css theme %}
        	<script src="path/to/jquery"></script>
        	{% smartmenus_js %}
        
          ``theme`` is a string based parameter. Out of box, ``theme`` can be one of 'sm-blue', 'sm-clean', 'sm-mint' and 'sm-simple'. If you create a custom theme of your own, please put the theme file under static folder following smartmenus theme folder structure convention, ie. smartmenus/css/``theme``/``theme``.css.
        
        
        - Render menu html in the templates. Please refer to smartmenus tutorial to see what the html should be.
        
        
        This app also supports Django CMS:
        
        - load smartmenus and menu tags in the templates::
        
        	{% load menu_tags smartmenus_tags %}
        
        
        - Call Django CMS specific template tags anywhere in the templates::
        
        	{% addtoblock "js" %}<script src="path/to/jquery"></script>{% endaddtoblock %}
        	{% smartmenu_bootstrap_cms theme %}
        
          ``theme``'s usage is the same as above.
        
        
        - Render Django CMS menu::
        
        	<ul class="sm theme-class-name">
        	    {% show_menu 0 100 100 100 %}
        	</ul>
        
          ``theme-class-name`` is a string based parameter. Please refer to smartmenus doc regarding possible values. Usually it's the same as theme name unless it's a custom theme with different naming conventions.
