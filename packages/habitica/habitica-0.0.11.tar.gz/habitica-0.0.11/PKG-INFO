        ========
        
        Two tools for interacting with [Habitica](http://habitica.com):
        
        1. Python wrapper for the RESTful Habitica API (`habitica.api`)
        2. Command-line interface with subcommands (e.g. `> habitica todos`)
        
        install
        -------
        
        First `pip install habitica`. Then, using `habiticarc.sample.json` as a
        template, you'll want to add your API credentials to an `~/.habiticarc` file in
        your home directory.
        
        Your userID and API token are available on the [Habitica options/setting/api
        page](https://habitica.com/#/options/settings/api).

        What's my character's status?
        
            > habitica status
            --------------
            Level 83 Rogue
            --------------
            Health: 50/50
            XP: 904/2690
            Mana: 133/218
            Pet: Gryphon-Base (11 food items)
            Mount: FlyingPig-Base
        
        Show me my todo items:
        
            > habitica todos
            [ ]  1 update habitica README with example instructions
            [ ]  2 vacuum the car
            [ ]  3 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"
            [ ]  4 order new contact lenses
            [ ]  5 complete Keppi project report and share with Geri
            [ ]  6 set up dinner with friends at Agava for Saturday night
        
        Complete a todo:
        
            > habitica todos done 1
            marked todo 'update habitica README with example instructions' complete
            [ ] 1 vacuum the car
            [ ] 2 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"
            [ ] 3 order new contact lenses
            [ ] 4 complete Keppi project report and share with Geri
            [ ] 5 make reservation at Agava for Saturday night
        
        Complete multiple todos. All `done`, `undo`, `up`, `down` commands can take 1
        or more tasks as arguments, using either comma-separated lists or ranges or
        both:
        
            > habitica todos done 1,3-5
            marked todo 'update habitica README with example instructions' complete
            marked todo 'vacuum the car' complete
            marked todo 'order new contact lenses' complete
            marked todo 'complete Keppi project report and share with Geri' complete
            marked todo 'make reservation at Agava for Saturday night' complete
            [ ] 1 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"
        
        Add a new (hard!) todo. By default `--difficulty=easy`:
        
            > habitica todos add finish dissertation --difficulty=hard
            added new todo 'finish dissertation'
            [ ] 1 finish dissertation
            [ ] 2 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"
        
        Show me my habits, and how well I'm doing with each:

            [****] 2 drink water
