Description: 
        Procdog is a simple command-line tool to start, stop, and check the health of
        processes.
        
        It is intended to be a simple, cross-platform alternative to standard tools
        like System V service scripts, Upstart, and systemd, for use in development, in
        build systems and test harnesses, etc.
        
        It operates by starting a simple daemon that popen()s and monitors the process.
        The daemon listens and accepts commands on a local Unix domain socket, making
        it possible to check the process is running or terminate it, and to do basic
        health checks. Every process is independent: There is a single Procdog daemon
        for each monitored process. The daemon exits if the process terminates.
        
        Many options can be set via a configuration file.
