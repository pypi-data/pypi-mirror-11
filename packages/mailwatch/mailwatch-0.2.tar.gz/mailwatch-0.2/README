Notes
-----

Mw does not care about the actual Read/Unread flags fo your messages, it
only cares if the mail is in the new/ subfolder of a box. This means that
it only shows mails that have not yet been moved to cur/. Some mail clients
move *all* mails they encounter to cur/ and just ste the unseen flag for 
them. Those mails will *not* be shown by mw.

Mw tries hard to parse Subjects, but not everybody knows how MIME works.
hence, mw sometimes displays "(none)" or may replace unprintable characters
with question marks (depending on your setting of "unprintables" in .mwrc). 
This is /not/ a shortcoming of mw, but of the senders mail infrastructure.
That said, mw usually shouldn't throw error messages at you for this; if
it does, please contact the author.
