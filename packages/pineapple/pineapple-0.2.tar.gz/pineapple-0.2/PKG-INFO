        ----------------
        
        This project is a Python module that defines some utility
        functions for the Pineapple IPython/Jupyter front-end.
        
        The goal is to standardize notebooks so that notebook authors
        can have a consistent and easy way for readers to reproduce their
        exact results with the least amount of hassle.
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        After importing the module, within IPython notebooks you get
        magic functions ``%pip``, ``%require``, and ``%runtest``.
        
        The ``%pip`` command lets you easily use the ``pip`` command
        directly to manage installed packages.
        
        The ``%require`` command shows all installed packages with versions
        if called with no arguments. If called with arguments, it will attempt
        to install the requested packages. Arguments are version specifiers,
        separated by spaces.
        
        The ``%runtest`` command takes any number of test case or test suite
        classes descended from ``unittest.TestCase`` or ``unittest.TestSuite``
        and runs them in the cell. It should also be compatible with ``unittest2``.

            %require
