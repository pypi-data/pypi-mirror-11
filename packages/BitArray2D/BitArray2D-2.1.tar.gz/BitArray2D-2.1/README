You have downloaded Version 2.1 of the BitArray2D module.
This version, compliant as it is with Python 3.x, should
work with both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.

This class was previously called Bit2DArray (Version 2.0).
Its name was changed to BitArray2D upon user requests.  The
new name is easier to roll off the tongue.

The BitArray2D class is for a memory-efficient packed
representation of 2D bit arrays and for logical and other
operations on such arrays. The implementation of the class
takes advantage of the facilities of the BitVector class
(Version 3 or higher) for the memory representation and for
the permitted operations.

Future versions of this module are expected to provide
support for blob analysis of 2D bit arrays.

You must have the BitVector class (Version 3.0 or higher)
already installed for BitArray2D class to work.

For ordinary installation, do the usual in the directory
in which you unpacked the tar archive:

           python setup.py install

See the code in BitArray2DDemo.py in the Examples directory
for how to use this class.
