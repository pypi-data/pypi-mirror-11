The file

      BitArray2DDemo.py

shows how you can use the BitArray2D class.

The class uses the following files in the demonstration:

      data.txt

      data2.txt

      out1.txt

      data_binary.dat

      out2.dat               

The last two files are for demonstrating constructing a 2D
bit array from a binary file (data_binary.dat) and writing a
bit array to a binary file (out2.dat).  For our toy
demonstration here, you can actually see the contents of
these two files, but, in general, the bytes in these files
would not be displayable.

The module files

      BitArray2D.py
      BitVector.py

are included in this directory just so that you can play
with the demo file BitArray2DDemo.py even before you install
the above two modules.
