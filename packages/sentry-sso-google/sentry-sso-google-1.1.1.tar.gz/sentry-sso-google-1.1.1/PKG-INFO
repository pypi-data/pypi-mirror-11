        =================
        
        Google SSO support for Sentry 7.5 and above.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add ``sentry_sso_google`` to your Sentry config's ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        The following settings are required to be in your Sentry configuration.
        You can create a new project in the `Developers
        Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`__. From there, go to
        APIs & Auth, Credentials and get the credentials for a web application.
        You will also need to enable 'Google+ API' in the APIs section.
        
        -  ``GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID``
        -  ``GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET``
        
        You can limit who can sign into Sentry using this provider by setting
        the ``GOOGLE_WHITE_LISTED_DOMAINS`` to a list of allowed domains. For
        example, to limit to ``educreations.com`` users, one could do:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            GOOGLE_WHITE_LISTED_DOMAINS = ['educreations.com']
        
        Go to the 'Auth' section of your organization's settings.
        
        Click the 'Configure' next to 'Google'.
