                    lists of strings describing possible reasons for the

        Posted BSOs whose ids do not appear in either "success" or "failed"
        should be treated as having failed for an unspecified reason.

        Note that the server may impose a limit on the total amount of data
        included in the request, and/or may decline to process more than a
        certain number of BSOs in a single request. The default limit on the
        number of BSOs per request is 100.
