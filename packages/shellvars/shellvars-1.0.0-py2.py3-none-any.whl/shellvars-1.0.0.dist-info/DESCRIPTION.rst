=========
Shellvars
=========

A Python interpreter for shell variable expressions.

shellvars supports Python 2.6 and up, and should support Jython etc as well.

The following expressions are supported:

* ``$NAME``
* ``${NAME}``
* ``${NAME:-REPLACEMENT}``
* ``${NAME-REPLACEMENT}``
* ``${NAME:=REPLACEMENT}``
* ``${NAME=REPLACEMENT}``
* ``${NAME:?[ERRORMSG]}``
* ``${NAME?[ERRORMSG]}``
* ``${NAME:+REPLACEMENT}``
* ``${NAME+REPLACEMENT}``

Recursive expressions are supported too. For instance::

  >>> from shellvars import evaluate
  >>> evaluate('${foo:-${bar:=baz}}', {})
  ('baz', {'bar': 'baz'})

For details on shell variable syntax, consult your shell or Posix
documentation.

Usage
=====

To evaluate an expression call ``evaluate`` with the expression and any
variables you want available to the expression. Variables keys and values must
both be strings.  Variables that are missing from your variable dict are
considered 'unset' in shell terms.

The return is an evaluated string and any variable assignments performed
by the expression.

Preserving unset expressions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

shellvars has a special mode where expressions that are for unset variables
are preserved rather than evaluated. This permits passing them onto a real
shell to interpret without needing special quoting from the user. For
instance::

 >>> from shellvars import SKIP
 >>> evaluate('$foo $bar', {'foo': 'baz'}, absent=SKIP)
 ('baz $bar', {})
