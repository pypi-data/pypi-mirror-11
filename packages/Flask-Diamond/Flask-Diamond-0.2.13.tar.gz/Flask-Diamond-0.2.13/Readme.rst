Flask-Diamond provides a path that can guide your thought and development; Flask-Diamond is the road that leads to other ideas.

Flask-Diamond is a python Flask application platform that roughly approximates a django.  Flask-Diamond imports many other Flask libraries, and then glues them all together with sensible defaults.  The end result is a model administration view, accounts and high-level account operations (e.g. password reset), testing, documentation, project management (e.g. deployment), and more.
