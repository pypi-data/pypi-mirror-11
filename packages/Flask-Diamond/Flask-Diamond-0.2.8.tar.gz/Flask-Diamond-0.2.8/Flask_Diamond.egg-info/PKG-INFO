Description:         Flask-Diamond is a python Flask application platform that roughly approximates a django.
                Flask-Diamond imports many other Flask libraries, and then glues them all together with
                sensible defaults.  The end result is a model administration view, accounts and high-level
                account operations (e.g. password reset), testing, documentation, project management
                (e.g. deployment), and more.
