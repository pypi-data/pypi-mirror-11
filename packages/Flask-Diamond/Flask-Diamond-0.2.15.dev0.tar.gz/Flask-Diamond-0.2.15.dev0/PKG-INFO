Description: Flask-Diamond
        =============
        
        **Flask-Diamond** is a batteries-included Flask framework. Easily scaffold a working application with sensible defaults, then override the defaults to customize it for your goals.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        **Flask-Diamond** imports many other Flask extensions and glues them all together.  The end result is a model administration view, accounts and high-level account operations (e.g. password reset), testing, documentation, project management (e.g. deployment), and more.
