  from the output.
   
0.4.0 (2015-08-17)
==================

* Added SETTINGS['rst_output'] to facilitate debugging rst errors
  in the Javascript source.  The default is None (no separate output file).

* Fixed indentation error in module property definitions:  handle case of
  ``module_prop_description_missing == ''`` properly.

0.3.0 (2015-06-03)
==================

In some build environments it is not possible to know ahead of time 
either the current directory
or your project's relation to it.  
With this change you can set the project's base address
so that a relative path argument can be made absolute at run-time.

* SETTINGS['react_docgen'] may now include arguments.

* Added DEFAULT_OPTIONS['path_index'].  Default is 0.

* Added keyword argument to run_react_docgen(): options=DEFAULT_OPTIONS

* Added keyword option to Formatter.__init__() 
  and react_doc_to_rst(): args=''

0.2.0 (2015-05-31)
==================

react_docgen() has always referenced the initial value of REACT_DOCGEN.
With this change you can now set 
which react-docgen command to run 
within conf.py.
