Optical Remote Sensing
===============================

OpticalRS is a free and open source Python implementation of passive optical remote sensing methods for the derivation of bathymetric maps and maps of submerged habitats. Some of these implementations are my original work and some are my interpretation of methods from journal papers. Citations will be found throughout this documentation to give credit to the original authors.

This library is offered for use without any warranty of any kind in the hope that it can save other researchers the time required to implement these methods from scratch. The bits of code contained here have had various levels of testing. You must validate any results yourself. Please let me know if you find anything wrong or if you have any questions.
