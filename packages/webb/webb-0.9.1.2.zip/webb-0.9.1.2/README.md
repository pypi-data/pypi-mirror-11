This library is compatible with both Python 2 (2.x) as well as Python 3 (3.x) versions. It is a download-import-and-run program with no or little changes as required by users.

### Dependencies
There are **no dependencies** to this project. It functions entirely of the standard in-build library support. It does not need any external support or installations. Just download and run!!!

### Status
This is a stand-alone python script which is ready-to-run, but still under development. Many more features will be added to it shortly.

### Disclaimer
The crawler function lets you download  and crawl tons of web pages. Please do not download and crawl any pages of a domain without reading about the robot.txt file of that domain. 

It is inappropriate to violate the robot.txt file. This may even lead to the domain completely blocking your crawler and thus blacklisting it. It is also not appropriate to crawl pages at high rate as it may put a lot of pressure on the server.
