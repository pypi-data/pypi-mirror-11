Mcafee NGFW Firewall as a Service Integration
====

About
-------

This is not an official product of McAfee but a PoC implementation of the NGFW
FWaaS integration into OpenStack. Unreleased NGFW features are required to make
full use of this. Contact McAfee sales for a demonstration.

The code is still riddled with TODOs and will be refactored and cleaned up in
the near future.
