        Watcher Metering

        Introduction
        ============
        
        Watcher Metering collects system metrics and publishes them to a store.
        To do so, it is composed of two elements:
        
        - The ``Agent`` who collects the desired metrics and sends it to a publisher.
          The ``Agent`` is meant to run on each monitored host (container, VM, ...)
        - The ``Publisher`` who gathers measurements from one or more agent and pushes
          them to the desired store. The currently supported stores are Riemann
          (for CEP) and Ceilometer.
        
        This project is part of the Watcher_ project.
        
        For more information on Watcher_, you can also refer to its OpenStack wiki_
        page.

        Getting started
        ===============
        
        **Installing Requirements Linux Ubuntu**
        
        Linux Debian Procedure should work on Ubuntu and similar distributions:
        
        You need to install the following packages:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ sudo apt-get update
            $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev autoconf libtool unzip wget
        
        
        Moreover, this package uses nanomsg_ and nanoconfig_ as socket library.
        As no official ``Debian`` nor ``RedHat`` package has been released yet, these
        two have to be compiled from the sources.
        
        .. _nanomsg: https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg
        .. _nanoconfig: https://github.com/nanomsg/nanoconfig
        
        
        **Installing nanomsg**
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ wget https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/archive/0.6-beta.zip
            $ unzip 0.6-beta.zip
            $ cd nanomsg-0.6-beta
            $ ./autogen.sh
            $ ./configure
            $ make -j8
            $ sudo make install
            $ sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
        
        Please also refer the instructions available on their ``README`` files.
        
        
        **Installing nanoconfig**
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ wget https://github.com/nanomsg/nanoconfig/archive/master.zip
            $ unzip master.zip
            $ cd nanomsg-master
            $ cmake .
            $ make
            $ sudo make install
            $ sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
        
        Please also refer the instructions available on their ``README`` files.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        **Agent**
        
        The ``Agent`` configuration file sample, which is located at
        ``$(PROJECT_DIR)/etc/watcher-metering/agent.conf`` (where ``PROJECT_DIR`` is
        the root folder of this project) contains all the explanations for each of its
        field. Please refer to these notes to fully understand the role of each one of
        them.
        
        To run the agent you can use the following command:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ watcher-metering-agent --config-file=/etc/watcher-metering/agent.conf
        
        Or even:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ watcher-metering-agent --config-dir=/etc/watcher-metering
        
        This alternative will automatically take into account any other file containing
        some configuration related to the agent (useful for dynamically including
        third-party driver configuration).
        
        But if you want to learn more about all the options this command provides you
        can still use the following to access its documentation:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ watcher-metering-agent --help
        
        **Publisher**
        
        The ``Publisher`` configuration file (located at
        ``/etc/watcher-metering/publisher.conf``) contains all the explanations for
        each of its field. Please refer to these notes to fully understand the role
        of each one of them.
        
        To run the publisher you can use the following command:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ watcher-metering-publisher \
                --config-file=/etc/watcher-metering/publisher.conf
        
        Or even:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ watcher-metering-publisher --config-dir=/etc/watcher-metering
        
        This alternative will automatically take into account any other file containing
        some configuration related to the publisher (useful for dynamically including
        third-party driver configuration).
        
        But if you want to learn more about all the options this command provides you
        can still use the following to access its documentation:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            $ watcher-metering-publisher --help
