Testing matchers
================

To make tests involving data structures easier, the
``zope.testing.matchers`` modules provides objects that can be put
included in equality assertions.

    >>> from zope.testing import matchers
    >>> import datetime, time
    >>> a = matchers.Var()
    >>> b = matchers.Var(type=int)
    >>> c = matchers.Var(lambda x: x > 2)
    >>> (a, b, c, matchers.nowish, matchers.nowish) = (
    ...     1, 2, 3, datetime.utcnow()

    >>> d = matchers.Dict(a=a, b=b, c=c)
