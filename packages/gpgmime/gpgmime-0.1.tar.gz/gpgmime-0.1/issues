TODO:

* Need to implement decryption/verification
* Need to get sphinx docs in order

DONE:

* Docstrings currently claim that everything returns a copy of the message,
  without modifying the original. This may not actually be true currently; we
  should go through and verify that it's doing the right thing.
* Ought to be able to query whether a message is encrypted/signed.
