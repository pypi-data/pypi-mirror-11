PyMPL
-----
PyMPL is a python extension to the AMPL modelling language that adds
new statements for evaluating python code within AMPL models.
PyMPL also includes, among others, procedures for modelling piecewise
linear functions, compressed arc-flow graphs for vector packing,
lot-sizing reformulations, and sub-tour elimination constraints for TSP.
