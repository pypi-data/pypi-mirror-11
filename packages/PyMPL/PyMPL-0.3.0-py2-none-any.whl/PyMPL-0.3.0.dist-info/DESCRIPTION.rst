-----
PyMPL is a python extension to the AMPL modelling language that adds
new statements for evaluating python code within AMPL models.
PyMPL includes, among others, procedures for modelling piecewise linear
functions, arc-flow graphs for vector packing, and sub-tour elimination
constraints for TSP.
