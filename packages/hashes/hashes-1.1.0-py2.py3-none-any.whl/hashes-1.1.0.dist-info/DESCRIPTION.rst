Hashes
======

Hashes is a tool to quickly hash plaintext strings, or compare hashed values with a plaintext. The reason I wrote this is because when on an assessment, I don't, and won't, send hashes that I found to an online "hash generator" that I don't trust.  I'd rather have an easy way to generate hash values, or compare hashes to plaintext values, quickly.  Hashes does this.

Install:

```
# Create a virtualenv (e.g. venv)
virtualenv venv
# Activate the environment and install the requirements
source venv/bin/activate
pip install hashes
```

Use:
It's menu driven, if you have questions, just ask me

There are also command line options that can be shown with the -h or --help flag
```
hashes --help
```
