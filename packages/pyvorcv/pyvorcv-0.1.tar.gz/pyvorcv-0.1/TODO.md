# TODO

## VorCV

- [x] Add the Hough Circle Transform calibration script
- [x] Add the computer vision script
- [x] Add text informations in OpenCV windows: circle center and radius, draw
      the non-react window
- [ ] Remove the numpy dependency ?
- [ ] Try other params (accumulator resolution, ...): see what other people do
      on internet
- [ ] Compute control in three dimensions (relative width height and depth of
      the target on the screen). The depth is computed according to the radius
      of the target.
- [ ] Use a cross platform configuration file to save opencv calibration data
      (thresholds, ...) and pyax12 config (port, baudrate, ...)

## Mid-term and long-term TODO list

- [ ] Use other computer vision algorithms (pattern search, ...)
