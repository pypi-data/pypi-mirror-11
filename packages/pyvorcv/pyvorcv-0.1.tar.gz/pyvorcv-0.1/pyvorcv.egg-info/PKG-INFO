        Description
        ===========
        
        The PyVoR-CV project (Python based VoRobotics Computer Vision), is a computer
        vision library made for some VoRobotics projects (VoR11_, VoR12_, ...).
        PyVoR-CV is mostly based on the OpenCV_ computer vision library.

        Note:
        
            This project is still in beta stage, so the API is not finalized yet.

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        -  Python 3.4
        -  `OpenCV`_ versions 3.0.0 or above
        -  `NumPy`_
        
        .. PyVoR-CV is tested to work with Python 3.4 under Gnu/Linux Debian 8 and Windows
        .. 7.
        .. It should also work with Python 3.X under recent Gnu/Linux and Windows systems.
        .. It hasn't been tested (yet) on MacOSX and BSD systems.
        .. 
        .. `Python-serial`_ is required to install PyVoR-CV.
        
        Note:
        
        ..    If you use ``pip`` to install PyVoR-CV, PyAX-12 and Numpy will be
        ..    automatically downloaded and installed (see the following install_
        ..    section).
        
            OpenCV cannot be installed with ``pip``, thus you have to install it
            manually.

            pip install --pre pyvorcv
            pip install --upgrade pyvorcv
            pip uninstall pyvorcv
        
        Or, if you have downloaded the PyVoR-CV source code::
        
            python3 setup.py install
        
        .. There's also a package for Debian/Ubuntu::
