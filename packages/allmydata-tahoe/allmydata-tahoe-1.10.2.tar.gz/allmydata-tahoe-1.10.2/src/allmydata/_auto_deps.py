# The semantics for requirement specs changed incompatibly in setuptools 8,

# requirement specs to one of the following forms:
#
#   * >= X, <= Y where X < Y
#   * >= X, != Y, != Z, ... where X < Y < Z...
#
# (In addition, check_requirement in allmydata/__init__.py only supports
# >=, <= and != operators.)

# * On Linux we need at least Twisted 10.1.0 for inotify support
#   used by the drop-upload frontend.
# * We also need Twisted 10.1.0 for the FTP frontend in order for
#   Twisted's FTP server to support asynchronous close.
# * The SFTP frontend depends on Twisted 11.0.0 to fix the SSH server
#   rekeying bug <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4395>
# * The FTP frontend depends on Twisted >= 11.1.0 for
#   filepath.Permissions
#
# On Windows, Twisted >= 12.2.0 has a dependency on pywin32.
# Since pywin32 can only be installed manually, we fall back to
# requiring earlier versions of Twisted and Nevow if it is not
# already installed.
# <https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/2028>
#
# When the fallback is used we also need to work around the fact
# that Nevow imports itself when building, which causes Twisted
# and zope.interface to be imported; therefore, we need to set
# setup_requires to make sure that the versions of Twisted and
# zope.interface used at build time satisfy Nevow's requirements.
#
# In cases where this fallback isn't needed, we prefer Nevow >= 0.11.1
# which can be installed using pip, and Twisted >= 13.0.0 which
# Nevow 0.11.1 depends on. In this case we should *not* use the
# setup_requires hack, because if we do then the build will break
# when Twisted < 13.0.0 is already installed (even though it could
# have succeeded by building a later version under support/ ).

# * pyOpenSSL is required in order for foolscap to provide secure connections.
#   Since foolscap doesn't reliably declare this dependency in a machine-readable
#   way, we need to declare a dependency on pyOpenSSL ourselves. Tahoe-LAFS does
#   not *directly* depend on pyOpenSSL.
#
# * pyOpenSSL >= 0.13 is needed in order to avoid
#   <https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/2005>, and also to check the
#   version of OpenSSL that pyOpenSSL is using.
#
# * pyOpenSSL >= 0.14 is built on the 'cryptography' package which depends
#   on 'cffi' (and indirectly several other packages). Unfortunately cffi
#   attempts to compile code dynamically, which causes problems on many systems.
#   It also depends on the libffi OS package which may not be installed.
#   <https://bitbucket.org/cffi/cffi/issue/109/enable-sane-packaging-for-cffi>
#   <https://bitbucket.org/cffi/cffi/issue/70/cant-install-cffi-using-pip-on-windows>
#
#   So, if pyOpenSSL 0.14 has *already* been installed and is importable, we
#   want to accept it; otherwise we ask for pyOpenSSL 0.13 or 0.13.1.
#   <https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/2193>
#
#   We don't rely on pkg_resources to tell us the installed pyOpenSSL version
#   number, because pkg_resources telling us that we have 0.14 is not sufficient
#   evidence that 0.14 will be the imported version (or will work correctly).
#   One possible reason why it might not be is explained in
#   <https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/1246#comment:6> and
#   <https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/1258>.
