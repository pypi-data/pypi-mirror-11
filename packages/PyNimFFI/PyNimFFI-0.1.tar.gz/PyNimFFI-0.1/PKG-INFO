Description: 
        A wrapper to allow nim functions to be called in Python.
        
        It requires a nim package (also called PyNimFFI) to be installed, through nimble.
        
        It uses cffi, and has some performance overhead, but has a reasonable number of features.
        
        Ints, cstrings, and floats can be sent natively.
        
        Exceptions are wrapped, and propagated back to Python.
        
        Opaque types can be wrapped as subclasses of a "NimBase" class, and have a delete method created (which decrements the nim ref count - allowing garbage collection to happen correctly).
        
        Note, there is apparently another nim / python bridge in the works, and may turn out to be better.
