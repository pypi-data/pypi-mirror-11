        vmakedk provides command-line tools for creating VMDK images
        backed by sparse files based on a user supplied layout described
        with JSON.
        
        In most cases, it runs as root and performs the following:
        
        * Create sparse files to provide the backing store for each VMDK
        * Generate VMDK descriptior files for all disks
        * Create filesystems (mkfs) with labels for each disk
        * Attach free loopback devices (/dev/loopN) to each disk image
        * Mount all devices in a sandbox/chroot environment
        
        It can also output an appropriate /etc/fstab for the same layout.
