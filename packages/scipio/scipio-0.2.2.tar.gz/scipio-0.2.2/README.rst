Scipio
======

Scipio scripts the download & build of Cocoa frameworks. Scipio's offered as an alternative to Carthage and CocoaPods. Scipio uses similar Cartfiles to Carthage and the basic workflow is the same:

1. Install Scipio
2. Create a Cartfile that lists the frameworks you’d like to use
3. Type scipio and Scipio will fetch and build each framework you’ve listed
4. Drag the framework binaries into your application’s Xcode project
