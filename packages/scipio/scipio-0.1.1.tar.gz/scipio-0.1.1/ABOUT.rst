Scipio
======

Scipio scripts the download & building frameworks of Cocoa frameworks. Scipio's offered as an alternative to Carthage and CocoaPods.

Scipio uses Cartfiles as Carthage and the basic workflow is the same:

1 Install Scipio
2 Create a Cartfile that lists the frameworks you’d like to use
3 Type scipio and Scipio will fetch and build each framework you’ve listed
4 Drag the framework binaries into your application’s Xcode project
