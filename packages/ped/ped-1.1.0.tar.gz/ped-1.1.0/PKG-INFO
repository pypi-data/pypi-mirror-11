        Open a python module in your text editor.
        
        ::
        
            $ ped django
            $ ped django.core.urlresolvers
        
            # Classes and functions work, too
            $ ped django.views.generic.TemplateView
        
            # Specify which editor to use
            $ PED_EDITOR=vim ped django.shortcuts
        
        
        ``ped`` will find your modules in the currently-active virtual environment.
        
        
        Get it now
        **********
        ::
        
            $ pip install ped
        
        
        Changing the default editor
        ***************************
        
        ``ped`` will try to find your favorite text editor. If you want to override the editor ``ped`` uses, set the ``PED_EDITOR`` environment variable.
        
        ::
        
            # .zshrc or .bashrc
            # Use Sublime Text with ped
            export PED_EDITOR=subl
        
        
        Kudos
        *****
        
        This was inspired by `IPython's <https://ipython.org/>`_ ``%edit`` magic.
