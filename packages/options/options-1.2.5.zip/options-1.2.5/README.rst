``options`` helps represent option and configuration data in a clean,
high-function way. Changes to options can "overlay" earlier or default
settings.

For most functions and classes, ``options`` is overkill. Python's regular function
arguments, ``*args``, ``**kwargs``, and inheritance patterns are elegant and
sufficient for 99.9% of all development situations. ``options`` is for the
top 0.1%:

  * highly functional classes or functions,
  * with many different features and options,
  * which might be adjusted or overriden at any time,
  * yet that need "reasonable" or "intelligent" defaults, and
  * that yearn for a simple, unobtrusive API.

In those cases, Python's simpler built-in, inheritance-based model
adds complexity. Non-trivial options and argument-management
code spreads through many individual methods. This is where
``options``'s layered, delegation-based approach begins to shine.
