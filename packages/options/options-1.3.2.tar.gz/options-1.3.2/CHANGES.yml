    Doc and config tweaks.

    Python 2.6 support wavering, primarily because of failure of ``stuf`` 0.9.16 to
    build there. 0.9.14 works fine. But either ``stuf`` support will have to improve
    (I've submitted a pull request that fixes the problem), or we'll have to swap
    ``stuf`` out, or we''ll have to decomit py26.

  version: 1.1.7
  date: December 16, 2014
  notes: Added snazzy badges to PyPI readme

-
  version: 1.1.5
  date: December 16, 2014
  notes: Changed dependencies to utilize new ``nulltype`` package (unbundling it).
    Ensured tested on all lastest Python versions.

-
  version: 1.1.1
  date: October 29, 2013
  notes: Added ``OptionsClass`` base class. If client classes inherit from this, they
    automatically get ` set()`` and ``settings()`` methods.

-
  version: 1.0.7
  date: October 25, 2103
  notes: Mainly doc tweaks.

-
  version: 1.0.4
  date: October 24, 2013
  notes: >
    When bad option names are defined ("bad" here meaning "conflicts with names
    already chosen for pre-existing methods"), a ``BadOptionName`` exception will
    be raised.

    Tweaked docs, adding comparison chart.

-
  version: 1.0.3
  date: September 23, 2013
  notes: Switched to local version of ``chainstuf`` until bug with generator values
    in ``stuf.chainstuf`` can be tracked down and corrected. This was blocking a downstream
    feature-release of ``say``.

-
  version: 1.0.2
  date: September 19, 2013
  notes: >
    Improved ``setdefault`` and ``update`` methods, and added tests, primarily
    in effort to work around bug that appears in ``stuf``, ``orderedstuf``, or ``chainstuf``
    when a mapping value is a generator.

    Documentation improved.

-
  version: 1.0.1
  date: September 14, 2013
  notes: Moved main documentation to Sphinx format in ./docs, and hosted the long-form
    documentation on readthedocs.org. README.rst now an abridged version/teaser for
    the module.

-
  version: 1.0.0
  date: September 10, 2013
  notes: >
    Cleaned up source for better PEP8 conformance

    Bumped version number to 1.0 as part of move to `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`_,
    or at least enough of it so as to not screw up Python installation procedures
    (which don't seem to understand 0.401 is a lesser version that 0.5, because 401
    > 5).
