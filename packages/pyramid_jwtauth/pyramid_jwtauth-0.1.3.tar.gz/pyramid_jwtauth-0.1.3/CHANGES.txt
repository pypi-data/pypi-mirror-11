Updated package requires to need PyJWT.

0.0.1.dev4

Updated package so that it can be downloaded for use by Python 3.3/3.4

0.0.1.dev3

Now works properly with RSA keys and fixed issue with not doing a 401 with
the appropriate challenge.
Dropped support for Python 2.6 and 3.2

0.1.1

Works with PyJWT 0.4.x (also unpinned).  Contributions by (Wichert Akkerman
<wichert@wiggy.net>) that enable the auth to use a 'Bearer' header rather than
the custom header 'JWT'.

Dropped support for Python 3.3 in tox, but it should still work fine.

Addition (from development) perspective of using Vagrant to develop and
tox-test the package against python 2.7 and 3.4

0.1.2

Added ability to disable various checks via the PyJWT options{} in the decode()
method.  This is configured in the policy via the Pyramid setting system.

0.1.3

Merged PR#11 from Shadizzle to provide ability to configure 'scheme' from the
INI file. Bumped version to 0.1.3.
