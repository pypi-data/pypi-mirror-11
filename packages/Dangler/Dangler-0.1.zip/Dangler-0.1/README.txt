===============================================
Dangler - A Python script to expand hamlet templates file (Html without closing tags) into html 
===============================================

The problem -
=============

Writing HTML can be a pain if you are doing it by hand. Things can be considerable improved if
you can write Html in python style, using indentation instead closing tags to delimit blocks
This is something that is shamelessly copied from Haskell's hamlet templates.

Usage: dangler path/to/file/with/unclosed/tags.html

This will print out html with tags closed.

Have fun!
