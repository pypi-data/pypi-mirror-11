        Ark
        ===
        
        Ark is a static website generator in Python 3. It transforms a directory of
        text files into a self-contained website that can be viewed locally or
        served remotely.
        
        Ark is highly extensible. It has builtin support for text files written in
        `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_ and
        `Syntex <https://github.com/dmulholland/syntex>`_ but can be extended via
        plugins to support any similar text-to-html format.
        
        See the `package documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/ark/>`_ or the project's
        `Github homepage <https://github.com/dmulholland/ark>`_ for further details.
