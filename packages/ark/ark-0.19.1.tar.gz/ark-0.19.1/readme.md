Ark
===

Ark is a static website generator in Python. It transforms a directory of text files into a self-contained website that can be viewed locally or served remotely.

Ark is highly extensible. It has builtin support for text files written in [Markdown][] and [Syntex][], and can be extended via plugins to support any similar text-to-html format.

See the project's [documentation][] for further details.
