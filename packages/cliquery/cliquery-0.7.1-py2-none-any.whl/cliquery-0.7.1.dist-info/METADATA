# cliquery

## a command-line browsing interface
cliquery is a command-line interface which bundles important features of modern browsers and the quickness of the command-line. It supports searching via Bing, previewing, bookmarking, `Feeling Lucky`, or simply opening the browser or URI's directly. An interactive interface allows users to make successive queries without exiting the program, typing help will list all possible commands. When a user chooses a link to open cliquery will invoke either their browser of choice or the default browser.

cliquery offers less clicking, faster results, and *no limitations to regular browsing!*

## Installation
* `pip install cliquery`
* [Sign up (optional)](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) for a WolframAlpha API key.
* (recommended) Enter your API key and choice of browser in .cliqrc (cygwin users *must* enter `cygwin` as their browser).

## Usage
    usage: cliquery.py [-h] [-b] [-c] [-C] [-d] [-f] [-o] [-s] [-v] [-w]
                       [QUERY [QUERY ...]]

    a command-line browsing interface

    positional arguments:
      QUERY              keywords to search

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      -b, --bookmark     view and modify bookmarks
      -c, --config       print location of config file
      -C, --clear-cache  clear the cache
      -d, --describe     display page snippet
      -f, --first        open first link
      -o, --open         open link or browser manually
      -s, --search       display search links
      -v, --version      display current version
      -w, --wolfram      display wolfram results

## Author
* Hunter Hammond (huntrar@gmail.com)

## Notes
* Supports both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
* If you receive the following message when trying to add bookmarks:
    ```
    IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc'
    ```
Enter the following to fix:
    ```
    sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc
    ```
* A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts, or instead a page of search results comprised of descriptive links to follow.
* Interactive use is as easy as passing the regular flag arguments into the link prompt; this overrides any preexisting flags and allows for more even more flexibility. Entering h or help will list all possible prompt commands.

* To choose multiple links at once, a range may be specified by separating the start and end range with a dash. Leaving one end of the range blank will choose all links until the other end of that range. For example, given 10 links, entering 5- would effectively be the same as entering 5-10.
* Using the bookmarks flag with no arguments will list all current bookmarks in .cliqrc, ordered by time of entry. Adding and deleting bookmarks can be done using add [url] or del [num] or [suburl], where [suburl] is a substring of the url. Opening bookmarks is done through the bookmarks flag and either a [num] or [suburl] argument. Bookmarks may also be added interactively through the link prompt by entering b [num].
