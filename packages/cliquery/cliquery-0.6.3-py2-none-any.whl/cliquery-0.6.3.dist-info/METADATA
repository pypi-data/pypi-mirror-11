# cliquery

## a command-line browsing interface
cliquery is a command-line interface meant to bundle important features of a conventional browser and the quickness of the command-line. It supports previewing webpages, bookmarks, 'Feeling Lucky' searches, as well as regular web searches or simply entering URI's directly. cliquery is **_NOT_** a command-line browser such as Lynx, but it does have an interactive interface that makes it quick and easy to perform multiple searches and other operations. When a user decides to actually open a link, cliquery simply invokes their browser of choice! Supported in both Python 2.x and 3.x.

The results? Less clicking, faster results, and *no limitations to regular browsing!*

## Installation
* `pip install cliquery`
* [Sign up (optional)](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) for a WolframAlpha API key.
* Enter your API key and choice of browser in .cliqrc (cygwin users should enter `cygwin` as their browser). An example .cliqrc is available in cliquery/.cliqrc
* The API key and browser fields may be left blank but limits functionality.

## Usage
    usage: cliquery.py [-h] [-b] [-c] [-d] [-f] [-o] [-s] [-v] [-w]
                       [QUERY [QUERY ...]]

    a command-line browsing interface

    positional arguments:
      QUERY           keywords to search

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help      show this help message and exit
      -b, --bookmark  view and modify bookmarks
      -c, --config    print location of config file
      -d, --describe  display page snippet
      -f, --first     open first link
      -o, --open      open link or browser manually
      -s, --search    display search links
      -v, --version   display current version
      -w, --wolfram   display wolfram results

## Notes
* If you receive the following message when trying to add bookmarks:
    ```
    IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc'
    ```
Enter the following to fix:
    ```
    sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc
    ```

* A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts, or instead a page of search results comprised of descriptive links to follow.

* Interactive use is as easy as passing the regular flag arguments into the link prompt; this overrides any preexisting flags and allows for more even more flexibility.

* Entering h or help will bring up the list of possible commands to pass to the prompt.

* To choose multiple links at once, a range may be specified by separating the start and end range with a dash. Leaving one end of the range blank will choose all links until the other end of that range. For example, given 10 links, entering 5- would effectively be the same as entering 5-10.

* Using the bookmarks flag with no arguments will list all current bookmarks in .cliqrc, ordered by time of entry. Adding and deleting bookmarks can be done using add [url] or del [num] or [suburl], where [suburl] is a substring of the url. Opening bookmarks is done through the bookmarks flag and either a [num] or [suburl] argument. Bookmarks may also be added interactively through the link prompt, like all other flags.
