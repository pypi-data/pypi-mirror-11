This is the bsddb185 module from Python 2.6.  It is not present in Python 3,
but still might be useful, especially on BSD Unix variants which still use
Berkeley DB 1.85 hash files.  Because of known bugs in the underlying
library which were only fixed by modifying the hash file format you should
not use this module for new development.
