Description: ripe-atlas-tools
        ================
        
        The official command-line client for RIPE Atlas.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Currently, only Python's package manager (``pip``) is supported:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install ripe.atlas.tools
        
        Or if you want to live on the edge and perhaps try submitting a pull request of
        your own:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install git+github.com:RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-tools.git#egg=ripe.atlas.tools
        
        Note that there are lots of dependencies that will automatically be drawn in and
        installed at the moment, but we're going to try to scale that down.  Currently
        only three packages are required, but they each have a lot of dependencies:
        
        ::
        
            ripe.atlas.cousteau
                python-dateutil
                socketIO-client
                    websocket-client
                        backports.ssl-match-hostname
            ripe.atlas.sagan
                IPy
                python-dateutil
                pytz
                pyOpenSSL
                    cryptography
                        idna
                        pyasn1
                        setuptools
                        enum34
                        ipaddress
                        cffi>=0.8
                            pycparser
            tzlocal
                pytz
            pyyaml
        
        In the future, we're going to make it easier to install though, with an eye on
        integrating with end-user-friendly tools like ``apt``, ``rpm``, and ``emerge``.
        
        
        How Does it Work?
        -----------------
        
        Presently, the setup is pretty crude.  You can create a ping or traceroute
        measurement with limited options from the command line:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ ripe-atlas measure ping --target example.com
            $ ripe-atlas measure ping --packets 7 --size 42 --target example.com
            $ ripe-atlas measure traceroute --target example.com
            $ ripe-atlas measure traceroute --packets 2 --target example.com
            $ ripe-atlas measure dns --query-argument example.com
            $ ripe-atlas measure dns --use-probe-resolver --query-type AAAA --query-argument example.com
        
        This will create a one-off measurement and then wait for the results to roll in,
        formatting them as they do.
        
        You can also use it to connect to a stream of formatted data.  This command will
        start streaming out all of the results from one of our oldest measurements:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ ripe-atlas stream 1001
        
        Or you can generate a simple report:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ ripe-atlas report 1001
        
        Configuration is done by way of a config file, and modifying it can be done from
        the command line:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ ripe-atlas configure --set authorisation.create=MY_API_KEY
        
        
        Can I Contribute?
        -----------------
        
        Absolutely.  Pull requests are welcome, but give us a little time to get the
        architecture settled first.
