Description: red
        ===
        
        Python regex command-line tool, to replace functionality akin to 'perl -ne'.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From the project root directory::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use --help/-h to view info on the arguments::
        
            $ red --help
        
        The special variables available:
        
        - **line** for the entire line that was matched, without the trailing newline
        - **g** for groups, which you index to get that match group, as **g[0]** in "(\w+) .*"
        - **ag** for aggregated groups with the *-a* option, which is a list of all match groups
        - **d** for the groupdict, which you can index by named group as **d["foo"]** in "(?P<foo>\w+) .*"
        - **ad** for the aggregated group dicts, a list of dicts
        
        Example usage::
        
            $ cat test.txt 
            foo 1 bar 2
            fiz 5 baz 10
            funk 10 bunk 9
            funk a bunk b
            a b c d
            aaaaa
            bbbb
            cc
        
        Use it like grep::
        
            $ cat test.txt | red "\w+ (\d+) \w+ (\d+)" 
            foo 1 bar 2
            fiz 5 baz 10
            funk 10 bunk 9
        
        It works with path as argument as well, *but the path must appear directly after the regex* (oddity of argparse).::
            
            $ red "\w+ (\d+) \w+ (\d+)" test.txt
        
        Use it to evaluate Python code on groups stored in variable **g**::
        
            $ red "\w+ (\d+) \w+ (\d+)" test.txt -e "int(g[0]) + int(g[1])"
            3
            15
            19
        
        Import an arbitrary library and do absolutely anything::
        
            $ red '\w+ (\d+) \w+ (\d+)' test.txt -i json -e '"{} => {}".format(line, json.dumps(g))'
            foo 1 bar 2 => ["1", "2"]
            fiz 5 baz 10 => ["5", "10"]
            funk 10 bunk 9 => ["10", "9"]
        
        Use it to aggregate across all of stdin, into list **ag**::
        
            $ cat test.txt | red "\w+ (\d+) \w+ (\d+)" -a "sum([int(x[0]) for x in ag])"
            16
        
        Evaluate on each match, and aggregate against all matches::
        
            $ cat test.txt | red "\w+ (\d+) \w+ (\d+)" -a "sum([int(x[0]) for x in ag])" -e "'adding {}'.format(g[0])"
            adding 1
            adding 5
            adding 10
            16
        
        You can use named groups as well, stored in variables **d** and aggregated into **ad**::
        
            $ cat test.txt | red "\w+ (?P<first>\d+) \w+ \d+" -e "'first value is {first}'.format(**d)"
            first value is 1
            first value is 5
            first value is 10
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        
        Code in -e and -a are run through **eval**, so if you paste in code from someone,
        it will run. Just sayin'. Only run code you trust, or have inspected personally.
        The same goes for any library you import with -i.
