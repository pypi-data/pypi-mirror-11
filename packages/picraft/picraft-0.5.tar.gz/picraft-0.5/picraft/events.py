class Events(object):
    """
    This class implements the :attr:`~picraft.world.World.events` attribute.

    There are two ways of responding to picraft's events: the first is to
    :meth:`poll` for them manually, and process each event in the resulting
    list::

        >>> for event in world.events.poll():
        ...     print(repr(event))
        ...
        <BlockHitEvent pos=1,1,1 face="y+" player=1>,
        <PlayerPosEvent old_pos=0.2,1.0,0.7 new_pos=0.3,1.0,0.7 player=1>

    The second is to "tag" functions as event handlers with the decorators
    provided and then call the :meth:`main_loop` function which will handle
    polling the server for you, and call all the relevant functions as needed::

        @world.events.on_block_hit(pos=Vector(1,1,1))
        def hit_block(event):
            print('You hit the block at %s' % event.pos)

        world.events.main_loop()

    By default, only block hit events will be tracked. This is because it is
    the only type of event that the Minecraft server provides information about
    itself, and thus the only type of event that can be processed relatively
    efficiently. If you wish to track player positions, assign a set of player
    ids to the :attr:`track_players` attribute. If you wish to include idle
    events (which fire when nothing else is produced in response to
    :meth:`poll`) then set :attr:`include_idle` to ``True``.

    Finally, the :attr:`poll_gap` attribute specifies how long to pause during
    each iteration of :meth:`main_loop` to permit event handlers some time to
    interact with the server. Setting this to 0 will provide the fastest
    response to events, but will result in event handlers having to fight with
    event polling for access to the server.
    """

    def __init__(self, connection, poll_gap=0.1, include_idle=False):
        self._connection = connection
        self._handlers = []

        This property specifies the length of time to wait at the end of each

        The purpose of the pause is to give event handlers executing in the
        background time to communicate with the Minecraft server. Setting this
        to 0.0 will result in faster response to events, but also starves
        threaded event handlers of time to communicate with the server,
        resulting in "choppy" performance.

        The set of player ids for which movement should be tracked.

        By default the :meth:`poll` method will not produce player position
        events (:class:`PlayerPosEvent`). Producing these events requires extra
        interactions with the Minecraft server (one for each player tracked)
        which slow down response to block hit events.

        If you wish to track player positions, set this attribute to the set of
        player ids you wish to track and their positions will be stored.  The
        next time :meth:`poll` is called it will query the positions for all
        specified players and fire player position events if they have changed.

        Given that the :attr:`~picraft.world.World.players` attribute
        represents a dictionary mapping player ids to players, if you wish to
        track all players you can simply do::

        For example, to specify that one handler should be called for hits
        on the top of any blocks, and another should be called only for hits

        execute as many times as activated in parallel. When ``False``, a
        single instance of a threaded handler is allowed to execute at any
