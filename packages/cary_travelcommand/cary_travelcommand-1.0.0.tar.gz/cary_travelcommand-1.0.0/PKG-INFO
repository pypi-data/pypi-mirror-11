Description: 
        A Cary command for querying the US Government per diem tables
        and Google QPX to get a full trip quote; query by sending an email
        with the body of several lines describing the trip, such as
          lhr-dub 20-21 july staying in Kilkenny
          dub-cdg 21-23 july
          cdg-lhr 23 jul
        
        the parser is fairly permissive but gets tripped up periodically.
