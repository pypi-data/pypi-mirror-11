* Release 0.3 (22-Sep-2015)

Use the faster "M=N" blinding factors for SPAKE2_Symmetric, instead of
running two sessions in parallel and combining the results. This gets the
same speed and message size as the asymmetric (SPAKE2_A/SPAKE2_B) approach,
and is probably safe (see README for the security proofs).

* Release 0.2 (08-Apr-2015)

Use Ed25519 group/parameters by default (improves speed, security, and
message size). Note that both sides must use the same parameter set for
compatibility.

* Release 0.1 (13-Feb-2015)

Initial release. Includes SPAKE2_A/SPAKE2_B, and SPAKE2_Symmetric. Provides
three integer-group parameter sets (Params1024, Params2048, Params3072).
