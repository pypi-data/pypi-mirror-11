"""This cutie engine will help solving puzzles as they are published in different magazines and other media.
The only thing you will need to do is take a picture of it, and let this mighty little engine do his job.
It might even send out your calculated solution to its publishers so that you can attend gaming competitions.
Automated texting or mailing or whatever is needed to get you at the winning side, we will achieve it !
And, who knows, you might even end up with a bunch of iPads, bikes, holidays, ...
(I really know such a lady ! We'll do the same but without the thinking part)

Somehow... Someday... but lets first start learning some of this Python language"""

    Yep, it does what it exactly says: it runs the engine and take you by the hand.
