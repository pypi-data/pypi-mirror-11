    Consider a discrete trajectory :math`{ x_t }` with :math:`x_t \in {1, ..., n}`. For each starting state :math:`i`,
    we collect the target sequence

    .. mathh:
        Y^(i) = {x_{t+\tau} | x_{t}=i}

    which contains the time-ordered target states at times :math:`t+\tau` whenever we started in state :math:`i`
    at time :math:`t`. Then we define the indicator sequence:

    .. math:
        a^{(i,j)}_t (\tau) = 1(Y^(i)_t = j)

    The statistical inefficiency for transition counts :math:`c_{ij}(tau)` is computed as the statistical inefficiency
    of the sequence :math:`a^{(i,j)}_t (\tau)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtrajs : list of int-iterables
        discrete trajectories
    lag : int
        lag time
    C : scipy sparse matrix (n, n) or None
        sliding window count matrix, if already available
    truncate_acf : bool, optional, default=True
        When the normalized autocorrelation function passes through 0, it is truncated in order to avoid integrating
        random noise

    Returns
    -------
    I : scipy sparse matrix (n, n)
        Statistical inefficiency matrix with a sparsity pattern identical to the sliding-window count matrix at the
        same lag time. Will contain a statistical inefficiency :math:`I_{ij} \in (0,1]` whenever there is a count
        :math:`c_{ij} > 0`. When there is no transition count (:math:`c_{ij} = 0`), the statistical inefficiency is 0.

    """ Computes the statistically effective transition count matrix

    Given a list of discrete trajectories, compute the effective number of statistically uncorrelated transition
    counts at the given lag time. First computes the full sliding-window counts :math:`c_{ij}(tau)`. Then uses
    :func:`statistical_inefficiencies` to compute statistical inefficiencies :math:`I_{ij}(tau)`. The number of
    effective counts in a row is then computed as

    .. math:
        c_i^{\mathrm{eff}}(tau) = \sum_j I_{ij}(tau) c_{ij}(tau)

    and the effective transition counts are obtained by scaling the rows accordingly:

    .. math:
        c_{ij}^{\mathrm{eff}}(tau) = \frac{c_i^{\mathrm{eff}}(tau)}{c_i(tau)} c_{ij}(tau)

    This procedure is not yet published, but a manuscript is in preparation [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtrajs : list of int-iterables
        discrete trajectories
    lag : int
        lag time
    average : str, default='row'
        Use either of 'row', 'all', 'none', with the following consequences:
        'none': the statistical inefficiency is applied separately to each
            transition count (not recommended)
        'row': the statistical inefficiency is averaged (weighted) by row
            (recommended).
        'all': the statistical inefficiency is averaged (weighted) over all
            transition counts (not recommended).
    truncate_acf : bool, optional, default=True
        Mode of estimating the autocorrelation time of transition counts.
        True: When the normalized autocorrelation function passes through 0,
        it is truncated in order to avoid integrating random noise. This
        tends to lead to a slight underestimate of the autocorrelation time
    mact : float, default=2.0
        multiplier for the autocorrelation time. We tend to underestimate the
        autocorrelation time (and thus overestimate effective counts)
        because the autocorrelation function is truncated when it passes
        through 0 in order to avoid numerical instabilities.
        This is a purely heuristic factor trying to compensate this effect.
        This parameter might be removed in the future when a more robust
        estimation method of the autocorrelation time is used.
