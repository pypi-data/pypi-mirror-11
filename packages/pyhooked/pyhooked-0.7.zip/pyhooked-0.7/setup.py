long_description='''#PyHooked: a pure Python hotkey module
####About - 
PyHooked is a pure python keyboard hotkey that allows the creation of hotkeys in all Python implementations that support ctypes. Instead of messing around with low level Windows calls, just tell Hooked what your hotkey is and what function you want to call.

PyHooked supports IronPython (2.7), PyPy (newest repo version) and CPython (Tested:2.7,3.4 Most are likely to work) currently. It is pure Python, so porting should be very simple (see The Future below).

####Usage - 
It is really easy, just:
<pre>
from pyhooked import hook
def foo():
    print "foo"
hk=hook() #make a new instance of PyHooked
hk.Hotkey(["LCtrl","A"],foo) #add a new shortcut ctrl+a, that calls foo() when pressed
hk.listen() #start listening for key presses
</pre>
Read more in the [wiki](https://github.com/IronManMark20/PyHooked/wiki)!
####Installing

Just run `$ pip install git+https://github.com/IronManMark20/hooked.git`


####Alternatives -
[pyHook](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/) and [pyhk](https://github.com/schurpf/pyhk) inspired the creation of this project. They are great hotkey modules too!
####Extra - 
There is an example in the __init__.py file. You can run `python __init__.py` and it will start two hotkeys.
