Description: remote\_copy\_and\_execute
        ==========================
        
        
        remote\_copy\_and\_execute is a tool used to copy a script in batch to a set list of hosts, execute N at a time, and print the results.
        
        It uses the SSH protocol (ssh and scp utilities) to perform the acts. This is useful for a multiude of purposes, 
        
        from running custom audit scripts to deployment scripts, activation and really any batch task.
        
        
        **Example Usage:**
        
        
        
        	remote_copy_and_execute --rcae-at-a-time=3 --rcae-as-user=www --rcae-skip-bad-hosts ./myScriptName -- host1 host2 host3 host4 host5 host6 host7
        
        
        The above command will copy and execute execute as "www" the script "myScriptName" on 3 hosts at a time, until all given hosts are completed or failed, and print results on completion.
        
        
        	remote_copy_and_execute --rcae-batch --rcae-as-user=myuser /home/myuser/scripts/audit -- host1 host2 host3 host4
        
        The above command will copy and execute execute "/home/myuser/scripts/audit" on all of the given hosts, as "myuser", using common batch options.
        
        
        **All Options:**
        
        
        
        	Usage: remote_copy_and_execute [program] [args] (--) [hostname1] [hostnameN]
        
        	Copies a script and executes on multiple hosts simultaneously. Use "--" after the args and before the list of host names.
        
        	Script must be executable by the running user
        
        
        	remote_copy_and_execute arguments:
        
        		\-\-rcae-timeout=#seconds         to use a timeout.
        
        		\-\-rcae-omit-empty               Omit printing empty results
        
        		\-\-rcae-at-a-time=#              Split application into given # chunks
        
        		\-\-rcae-hide-date                Do not show runtime date
        
        		\-\-rcae-skip-bad-hosts           Skip bad hosts. Default is to terminate.
        
        		\-\-rcae-quiet                    Omit all output except that from the script. Implies hide-date
        
        		\-\-rcae-as-user=username         Perform copy and execute as given user. Default is root.
        
        		\-\-rcae-print-on-host-complete   Print right after each host completes execution. Default is to print at end of each set. Assumes rcae-hide-date.
        
        
        		\-\-rcae-batch                    Sets defaults [listed below]. Sane defaults for batch
        				                          executions. This directive is evaluated first, so you can override
        				                          the ones that take a paramater.
        
        					                        timeout=2
        					                        omit-empty
        					                        at-a-time=15
        					                        hide-date
        					                        skip-bad-hosts
        
        
        		--rcae-help                     Show this message
