This test checks to make sure that the locked fields keep their sanity through
the merge.


       Legislator 1

    Locked     Unlocked
 +-----------+-----------+
 |Leg2 (L00) | Leg2 (L01)| Locked
 +-----------+-----------+           Legislator 2
 |Leg1 (L10) | Leg2 (L11)| Unlocked
 +-----------+-----------+

(in all cases except Leg1 has a field that's locked and Leg2's is unlocked,
 copy the value from Leg2 to Leg1)

 L00 L2 -> L1
 L01 L2 -> L1
 L10 L1 -> L1
 L11 L2 -> L1

This might help explain the attributes and their values a bit more.
