# claw

Library to extract message quotations and signatures.
This is a more light-weight version of the original [mailgun/talon](https://github.com/mailgun/talon) library.

If you ever tried to parse message quotations or signatures you know that absence of any formatting standards in this area could make this task a nightmare.
Hopefully this library will make your life much easier.


## Usage

Here’s how you initialize the library and extract a reply from a text
message:


```python
import claw
from claw import quotations

claw.init()

text =  """Reply

-----Original Message-----

Quote"""

reply = quotations.extract_from(text, 'text/plain')
reply = quotations.extract_from_plain(text)
# reply == "Reply"
```

To extract a reply from html:

```python
html = """Reply
<blockquote>

  <div>
    On 11-Apr-2011, at 6:54 PM, Bob &lt;bob@example.com&gt; wrote:
  </div>

  <div>
    Quote
  </div>

</blockquote>"""

reply = quotations.extract_from(html, 'text/html')
reply = quotations.extract_from_html(html)
# reply == "<html><body><p>Reply</p></body></html>"
```

Often the best way is the easiest one. Here’s how you can extract
signature from email message without any
machine learning fancy stuff:

```python
from claw.signature.bruteforce import extract_signature


message = """Wow. Awesome!
--
Bob Smith"""

text, signature = extract_signature(message)
# text == "Wow. Awesome!"
# signature == "--\nBob Smith"
```

Quick and works like a charm 90% of the time. For other 10% you can use
the power of machine learning algorithms. See the original talon implementation.
