Markdown
========

An experimental Markdown formatter has been added. It is quite simple at
present, supporting just ``i`` (italics), ``b`` (bold), ``a`` (anchor, or
link), ``p`` (paragraph), ``h`` (header), and ``doc`` (document) functions.

List, image, blockquote, and code-block formatting are next steps.
At this demonstration stage, the goal is to stretch the ``quoter`` use-case
and prove/harden its extension mechanisms, which it is already doing. Stay
tuned for more extensive functions and documentation.
