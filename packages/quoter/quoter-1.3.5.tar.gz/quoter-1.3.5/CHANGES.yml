        Initiated external CI with Travis.

    version: 1.3.0
    date: August 11, 2015
    notes: >
        First release of integrated sequence joining.
        ``join``, ``word_join``, ``and_join``, ``or_join``, ``joinlines``, and
        ``items`` are functional and tested, but still less mature than the
        rest of the codebase.

        Tests and docs tweaked. Embedded ``nulltype`` module
        withdrawn in favor of full ``nulltype`` imported by ``options``.

-
    version: 1.0.3
    date: November 1, 2013
    notes: >
        HTML, XML, and lambda quoters now use class-relative styles
        dictionaries, as opposed to piggybacking the standard Quoter styles
        dictionary.
        
        Improved docs and tests.
        
        Added ``lambdaq`` front-end parallel to ``quote``, ``html``, and
        ``xml``.

    version: 1.0.2
    date: October 31, 2013
    notes: >
        Some internal cleanups to improve code reuse among classes. Bumped
        from Alpha to Beta status.

-
    version: 1.0.1
    date: October 31, 2013
    notes: >
        A new alternate API consisting of attribute names off of a default
        quoting object (e.g. ``quote.single`` as a specialization of
        ``quote``) has been instituted. This is mostly, but not perfectly, a
        superset of the previous use of a ``quote()`` function.
        
        The naming infrastructure has been beefed up, with multiple names
        (aliases) possible for all named objects.
        
        A new ``XMLQuoter`` is inserted as a superclass of ``HTMLQuoter`. It
        has ``HTMLQuoter``'s ability to parse CSS style id and class name
        definitions (e.g. ``'#first.big.special'``), as well as namespace
        support (new ``ns`` attribute).
        
        XML and HTML quoters for individual tags are automagically generated
        upon first use. E.g. ``html.b('this')`` creates an
        ``HTMLQuoter(tag='b', name='b')`` quoter that is cached as
        ``html.b`` for subsequent uses.
        
        Updated versioning strategy to comply with `PEP 386
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/>`_
        
        Various other structural and packaging cleanups. E.g. moved into
        proper Python package; given introspectable version number; removed
        old ``verno`` auto-update of version number; this proper change long
        instituted; etc.

-
    version: 0.308
    date: October 30, 2012
    notes: >
        Last version before PEP 386 versioning switch. Upgrade away from
        these old versions if for no other reason than improving the
        auto-install logic.
