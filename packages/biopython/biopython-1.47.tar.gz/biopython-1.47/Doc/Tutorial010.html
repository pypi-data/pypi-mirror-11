See Section&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial008.html#sec:entrez-guidelines">7.1</A>.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc85">9.1.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Sending a query to PubMed</H3><P>If you are in the Medical field or interested in human issues (and many times even if you are not!), PubMed (<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/"><TT>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/</TT></A>) is an excellent source of all kinds of goodies. So like other things, we&#X2019;d like to be able to grab information from it and use it in python scripts.</P><P>Querying PubMed using Biopython is extremely painless. To get all of the article ids for articles having to do with orchids (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial003.html#sec:orchids">2.3</A> for our motivation), we only need the following three lines of code:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import PubMed

search_term = 'orchid'
orchid_ids = PubMed.search_for(search_term)
</PRE><P>This returns a python list containing all of the orchid ids</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">['11070358', '11064040', '11028023', '10947239', '10938351', '10936520',
'10905611', '10899814', '10856762', '10854740', '10758893', '10716342',
...
</PRE><P>With this list of ids we are ready to start retrieving the records, so follow on ahead to the next section.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc86">9.1.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Retrieving a PubMed record</H3><P>The previous section described how to get a bunch of article ids. Now that we&#X2019;ve got them, we obviously want to get the corresponding Medline records and extract the information from them.</P><P>The interface for retrieving records from PubMed should be very intuitive to python programmers &#X2013; it models a python dictionary. To set up this interface, we need to set up a parser that will parse the results that we retrieve. The following lines of code get everything set up:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import PubMed
from Bio import Medline

rec_parser = Medline.RecordParser()
medline_dict = PubMed.Dictionary(parser = rec_parser)
</PRE><P>What we&#X2019;ve done is create a dictionary like object <CODE>medline_dict</CODE>. To get an article we access it like <CODE>medline_dict[id_to_get]</CODE>. What this does is connect with PubMed, get the article you ask for, parse it into a record object, and return it. Very cool!</P><P>Now let&#X2019;s look at how to use this nice dictionary to print out some information about some ids. We just need to loop through our ids (<CODE>orchid_ids</CODE> from the previous section) and print out the information we are interested in:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">for oid in orchid_ids[0:5]:
    cur_record = medline_dict[oid]
    print 'title:', cur_record.title.rstrip()
    print 'authors:', cur_record.authors
    print 'source:', cur_record.source.strip()
    print
</PRE><P>The output for this looks like:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">title: Sex pheromone mimicry in the early spider orchid (ophrys sphegodes):

'Ibarra F', 'Francke W']
source: J Comp Physiol [A] 2000 Jun;186(6):567-74
</PRE><P>Especially interesting to note is the list of authors, which is returned as a standard python list. This makes it easy to manipulate and search using standard python tools. For instance, we could loop through a whole bunch of entries searching for a particular author with code like the following:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">search_author = 'Waits T'

for our_id in our_id_list:
    cur_record = medline_dict[our_id]
   
    if search_author in cur_record.authors:
        print "Author %s found: %s" % (search_author,
                                       cur_record.source.strip())
</PRE><P>The PubMed and Medline interfaces are very mature and nice to work with &#X2013; hopefully this section gave you an idea of the power of the interfaces and how they can be used.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc47"></A><A NAME="htoc87">9.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;GenBank</H2><P>The GenBank record format is a very popular method of holding information about sequences, sequence features, and other associated sequence information. The format is a good way to get information from the NCBI databases at <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><TT>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</TT></A>.</P><P>The <CODE>Bio.GenBank</CODE> module uses the NCBI&#X2019;s Entrez interface to run searches and fetch data.
<EM>Please</EM> remember to read and observe the NCBI&#X2019;s guidelines on using their Entrez online facilities responsibly. If you are found to be abusing their servers, they can and will block your access! See Section&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial008.html#sec:entrez-guidelines">7.1</A>.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc88">9.2.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Retrieving GenBank entries from NCBI</H3><P>
<A NAME="genbank-retrieval"></A></P><P>One very nice feature of the GenBank libraries is the ability to automate retrieval of entries from GenBank. This is very convenient for creating scripts that automate a lot of your daily work. In this example we&#X2019;ll show how to query the NCBI databases, and to retrieve the records from the query - something touched on in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial005.html#sec:SeqIO_GenBank_Online">4.2.1</A>.</P><P>First, we want to make a query and find out the ids of the records to retrieve. Here we&#X2019;ll do a quick search for our favorite organism, <EM>Opuntia</EM>. We can do quick search and get back the GIs (GenBank identifiers) for all of the corresponding records:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import GenBank

gi_list = GenBank.search_for("Opuntia AND rpl16")
</PRE><P><CODE>gi_list</CODE> will be a list of all of the GenBank identifiers that match our query:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">["6273291", "6273290", "6273289", "6273287", "6273286", "6273285", "6273284"]
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got the GIs, we can use these to access the NCBI database through a dictionary interface. For instance, to retrieve the information for the first GI, we&#X2019;ll first have to create a dictionary that accesses NCBI:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">ncbi_dict = GenBank.NCBIDictionary("nucleotide", "genbank")
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got this, we do the retrieval:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">gb_record = ncbi_dict[gi_list[0]]
</PRE><P>In this case, <CODE>gb_record</CODE> will be GenBank formatted record:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">LOCUS       AF191665      902 bp    DNA             PLN       07-NOV-1999

            product, partial intron sequence.
ACCESSION   AF191665
VERSION     AF191665.1  GI:6273291
...
</PRE><P>In this case, we are just getting the raw records. We can also pass these records directly into a parser and return the parsed record. For instance, if we wanted to get back SeqRecord objects with the GenBank file parsed into SeqFeature objects we would need to create the dictionary with the GenBank FeatureParser:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">record_parser = GenBank.FeatureParser()
ncbi_dict = GenBank.NCBIDictionary("nucleotide", "genbank",
                                   parser = record_parser)
</PRE><P>Now retrieving a record will give you a SeqRecord object instead of the raw record:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; gb_seqrecord = ncbi_dict[gi_list[0]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print gb_seqrecord
&lt;Bio.SeqRecord.SeqRecord instance at 0x102f9404&gt;
</PRE><P>Using these automated query retrieval functionality is a big plus over doing things by hand. Although the module should obey the NCBI&#X2019;s three-second rule, the NCBI have other recommendations like avoiding peak hours. See Section&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial008.html#sec:entrez-guidelines">7.1</A>.</P><P>For more information of formats you can parse GenBank records into, please see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:gb-parsing">9.2.2</A>.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc89">9.2.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Parsing GenBank records</H3><P>
<A NAME="sec:gb-parsing"></A></P><P>While GenBank files are nice and have lots of information, at the same time you probably only want to extract a small amount of that information at a time. The key to doing this is parsing out the information. Biopython provides GenBank parsers which help you accomplish this task. Right now the GenBank module provides the following parsers:</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
RecordParser &#X2013; This parses the raw record into a GenBank specific Record object. This object models the information in a raw record very closely, so this is good to use if you are just interested in GenBank records themselves.</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">FeatureParser &#X2013; This parses the raw record in a SeqRecord object with all of the feature table information represented in SeqFeatures (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial011.html#sec:advanced-seq">10.1</A> for more info on these objects). This is best to use if you are interested in getting things in a more standard format. If you use <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> (Chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial005.html#chapter:Bio.SeqIO">4</A>) to read a GenBank file, it will call this FeatureParser for you.
</LI></OL><P>Depending on the type of GenBank files you are interested in, they will either contain a single record, or multiple records. Each record will start with a <TT>LOCUS</TT> line, various other header lines, a list of features, and finally the sequence data, ending with a <TT>//</TT> line.</P><P>Dealing with a GenBank file containing a single record is very easy. For example, let&#X2019;s use a small bacterial genome, <EM>Nanoarchaeum equitans Kin4-M</EM> (RefSeq NC_005213, GenBank AE017199) which can be downloaded from the NCBI here <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Bacteria/Nanoarchaeum_equitans/AE017199.gbk">(</A>only 1.15 MB):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import GenBank
feature_parser = GenBank.FeatureParser()
gb_record = feature_parser.parse(open("AE017199.gbk"))
# now do something with the record
print "Name %s, %i features" % (gb_record.name, len(gb_record.features))
print repr(gb_record.seq)
</PRE><P>Or, using <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> instead (see Chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial005.html#chapter:Bio.SeqIO">4</A>):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import SeqIO
gb_record = SeqIO.read(open("AE017199.gbk"), "genbank")
print "Name %s, %i features" % (gb_record.name, len(gb_record.features))
print repr(gb_record.seq)
</PRE><P>Either should give the following output:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">Name AE017199, 1107 features

</PRE><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc90">9.2.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Iterating over GenBank records</H3><P>
<A NAME="sec:gb-parsing-iterator"></A></P><P>For multi-record GenBank files, the most common usage will be creating an iterator, and parsing through the file record by record. Doing this is very similar to how things are done in other formats, as the following code demonstrates, using an example file <A HREF="http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/Tests/GenBank/cor6_6.gb">cor6_6.gb</A> which is included in the BioPython source code under the Tests/GenBank/ directory:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import GenBank
feature_parser = GenBank.FeatureParser()
gb_iterator = GenBank.Iterator(open("cor6_6.gb"), feature_parser)
for cur_record in gb_iterator :
   print "Name %s, %i features" % (cur_record.name, len(cur_record.features))
   print repr(cur_record.seq)
</PRE><P>Or, using <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> instead (see Chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial005.html#chapter:Bio.SeqIO">4</A>):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import SeqIO
for cur_record in SeqIO.parse(open("cor6_6.gb"), "genbank") :
   print "Name %s, %i features" % (cur_record.name, len(cur_record.features))
   print repr(cur_record.seq)
</PRE><P>This just iterates over a GenBank file, parsing it into SeqRecord and SeqFeature objects, and prints out the Seq objects representing the sequences in the record.</P><P>As with other formats, you have lots of tools for dealing with GenBank records. This should make it possible to do whatever you need to with GenBank.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc48"></A><A NAME="htoc91">9.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Dealing with alignments</H2><P>It is often very useful to be able to align particular sequences. I do this quite often to get a quick and dirty idea of relationships between sequences. Consequently, it is very nice to be able to quickly write up a python script that does an alignment and gives you back objects that are easy to work with. The alignment related code in Biopython is meant to allow python-level access to alignment programs so that you can run alignments quickly from within scripts.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc92">9.3.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Clustalw</H3><P>
<A NAME="sec:align_clustal"></A></P><P>Clustalx (<A HREF="http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/BioInfo/ClustalX/Top.html"><TT>http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/BioInfo/ClustalX/Top.html</TT></A>) is a very nice program for doing multiple alignments. Biopython offers access to alignments in clustal format (these normally have a <CODE>*.aln</CODE> extension) that are produced by Clustalx. It also offers access to clustalw, which the is command line version of clustalx.</P><P>We&#X2019;ll need some sequences to align, such as <A HREF="examples/opuntia.fasta">opuntia.fasta</A> (also available online <A HREF="http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/examples/opuntia.fasta">here</A>) which is a small FASTA file containing seven orchid gene DNA sequences, which you can also from <CODE>Doc/examples/</CODE> in the Biopython source distribution.</P><P>The first step in interacting with clustalw is to set up a command line you want to pass to the program. Clustalw has a ton of command line options, and if you set a lot of parameters, you can end up typing in a huge ol&#X2019; command line quite a bit. This command line class models the command line by making all of the options be attributes of the class that can be set. A few convenience functions also exist to set certain parameters, so that some error checking on the parameters can be done.</P><P>To create a command line object to do a clustalw multiple alignment we do the following:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">import os
from Bio.Clustalw import MultipleAlignCL

cline = MultipleAlignCL(os.path.join(os.curdir, "opuntia.fasta"))
cline.set_output("test.aln")
</PRE><P>First we import the <CODE>MultipleAlignCL</CODE> object, which models running a multiple alignment from clustalw. We then initialize the command line, with a single argument of the fasta file that we are going to be using for the alignment. The initialization function also takes an optional second argument which specifies the location of the <CODE>clustalw</CODE> executable. By default, the commandline will just be invoked with &#X2019;clustalw,&#X2019; assuming that you&#X2019;ve got it somewhere on your <CODE>PATH</CODE>.</P><P>The second argument sets the output to go to the file <CODE>test.aln</CODE>. The <CODE>MultipleAlignCL</CODE> object also has numerous other parameters to specify things like output format, gap costs, etc.</P><P>We can look at the command line we have generated by invoking the <CODE>__str__</CODE> member attribute of the <CODE>MultipleAlignCL</CODE> class. This is done by calling <CODE>str(cline)</CODE> or simple by printing out the command line with <CODE>print cline</CODE>. In this case, doing this would give the following output:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">clustalw ./opuntia.fasta -OUTFILE=test.aln
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve set up a simple command line, we now want to run the commandline and collect the results so we can deal with them. This can be done using the <CODE>do_alignment</CODE> function of <CODE>Clustalw</CODE> as follows:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import Clustalw

alignment = Clustalw.do_alignment(cline)
</PRE><P>What happens when you run this if that Biopython executes your command line and runs clustalw with the given parameters. It then grabs the output, and if it is in a format that Biopython can parse (currently only clustal format), then it will parse the results and return them as an alignment object of the appropriate type. So in this case since we are getting results in the default clustal format, the returned <CODE>alignment</CODE> object will be a <CODE>ClustalAlignment</CODE> type.</P><P>Once we&#X2019;ve got this alignment, we can do some interesting things with it such as get <CODE>seq_record</CODE> objects for all of the sequences involved in the alignment:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">all_records = alignment.get_all_seqs()

print "description:", all_records[0].description
print "sequence:", all_records[0].seq
</PRE><P>This prints out the description and sequence object for the first sequence in the alignment:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">description: gi|6273285|gb|AF191659.1|AF191
sequence: Seq('TATACATTAAAGAAGGGGGATGCGGATAAATGGAAAGGCGAAAGAAAGAAAAAAATGAAT
...', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())
</PRE><P>You can also calculate the maximum length of the alignment with:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">length = alignment.get_alignment_length()
</PRE><P>Finally, to write out the alignment object in the original format, we just need to access the <CODE>__str__</CODE> function. So doing a <CODE>print alignment</CODE> gives:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">CLUSTAL X (1.81) multiple sequence alignment


gi|6273285|gb|AF191659.1|AF191      TATACATTAAAGAAGGGGGATGCGGATAAATGGAAAGGCGAAAGAAAGAA
gi|6273284|gb|AF191658.1|AF191      TATACATTAAAGAAGGGGGATGCGGATAAATGGAAAGGCGAAAGAAAGAA
...
</PRE><P>This makes it easy to write your alignment back into a file with all of the original info intact.</P><P>If you want to do more interesting things with an alignment, the best thing to do is to pass the alignment to an alignment information generating object, such as the SummaryInfo object, described in section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:summary_info">9.3.2</A>.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc93">9.3.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Calculating summary information</H3><P>
<A NAME="sec:summary_info"></A></P><P>Once you have an alignment, you are very likely going to want to find out information about it. Instead of trying to have all of the functions that can generate information about an alignment in the alignment object itself, we&#X2019;ve tried to separate out the functionality into separate classes, which act on the alignment.</P><P>Getting ready to calculate summary information about an object is quick to do. Let&#X2019;s say we&#X2019;ve got an alignment object called <CODE>alignment</CODE>. All we need to do to get an object that will calculate summary information is:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.Align import AlignInfo

<A NAME="sec:pssm"></A></P><P>Position specific score matrices (PSSMs) summarize the alignment information in a different way than a consensus, and may be useful for different tasks. Basically, a PSSM is a count matrix. For each column in the alignment, the number of each alphabet letters is counted and totaled.

</LI></UL><P>Well, now that we have an idea what information content is being calculated in Biopython, let&#X2019;s look at how to get it for a particular region of the alignment.</P><P>First, we need to use our alignment to get a alignment summary object, which we&#X2019;ll assume is called <CODE>summary_align</CODE> (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:summary_info">9.3.2</A>) for instructions on how to get this. Once we&#X2019;ve got this object, calculating the information content for a region is as easy as:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">info_content = summary_align.information_content(5, 30,
                                                 chars_to_ignore = ['N'])
</PRE><P>Wow, that was much easier then the formula above made it look! The variable <CODE>info_content</CODE> now contains a float value specifying the information content over the specified region (from 5 to 30 of the alignment). We specifically ignore the ambiguity residue &#X2019;N&#X2019; when calculating the information content, since this value is not included in our alphabet (so we shouldn&#X2019;t be interested in looking at it!).</P><P>As mentioned above, we can also calculate relative information content by supplying the expected frequencies:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">expect_freq = {
    'A' : .3,
    'G' : .2,
    'T' : .3,
    'C' : .2}
</PRE><P>The expected should not be passed as a raw dictionary, but instead by passed as a <CODE>SubsMat.FreqTable</CODE> object (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="Tutorial011.html#sec:freq_table">10.4.2</A> for more information about FreqTables). The FreqTable object provides a standard for associating the dictionary with an Alphabet, similar to how the Biopython Seq class works.</P><P>To create a FreqTable object, from the frequency dictionary you just need to do:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC
from Bio.SubsMat import FreqTable

e_freq_table = FreqTable.FreqTable(expect_freq, FreqTable.FREQ,
                                   IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got that, calculating the relative information content for our region of the alignment is as simple as:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">info_content = summary_align.information_content(5, 30,
                                                 e_freq_table = e_freq_table,

</PRE><P>Now, <CODE>info_content</CODE> will contain the relative information content over the region in relation to the expected frequencies.</P><P>The value return is calculated using base 2 as the logarithm base in the formula above. You can modify this by passing the parameter <CODE>log_base</CODE> as the base you want:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">info_content = summary_align.information_content(5, 30, log_base = 10

acids with polar charged side chains. Luckily, this can be done easily
when generating a replacement dictionary, by passing in all of the

</PRE><P>This information gives us our accepted number of replacements, or how
often we expect different things to substitute for each other. It
turns out, amazingly enough, that this is all of the information we

residue, atom (or SMCRA) hierarchy. Fig. <A HREF="#fig:smcra">9.7.1</A> shows a UML
class diagram of the SMCRA data structure. Such a data structure is not
necessarily best suited for the representation of the macromolecular content of
a structure, but it is absolutely necessary for a good interpretation of the
data present in a file that describes the structure (typically a PDB or MMCIF
file). If this hierarchy cannot represent the contents of a structure file, it
is fairly certain that the file contains an error or at least does not describe
the structure unambiguously. If a SMCRA data structure cannot be generated,
there is reason to suspect a problem. Parsing a PDB file can thus be used to
detect likely problems. We will give several examples of this in section

</P><P>Structure, Model, Chain and Residue are all subclasses of the Entity base class.
The Atom class only (partly) implements the Entity interface (because an Atom
does not have children).</P><P>For each Entity subclass, you can extract a child by using a unique id for that
child as a key (e.g. you can extract an Atom object from a Residue object by
using an atom name string as a key, you can extract a Chain object from a Model
object by using its chain identifier as a key).</P><P>Disordered atoms and residues are represented by DisorderedAtom and DisorderedResidue
classes, which are both subclasses of the DisorderedEntityWrapper base class.
They hide the complexity associated with disorder and behave exactly as Atom
and Residue objects.</P><P>In general, a child Entity object (i.e. Atom, Residue, Chain, Model) can be
extracted from its parent (i.e. Residue, Chain, Model, Structure, respectively)
by using an id as a key.</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">child_entity=parent_entity[child_id]
</PRE><P>You can also get a list of all child Entities of a parent Entity object. Note

The full id is a tuple containing all id&#X2019;s starting from the top object (Structure)
down to the current object. A full id for a Residue object e.g. is something
like:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">full_id=residue.get_full_id()

The Residue id indicates that the residue is not a hetero-residue (nor a water)

residues with the same id to one chain). This really should be done via a nice

and the segment identifier of the residue (well known to X-PLOR users, but not
used in the construction of the SMCRA data structure).</P><P>The id of a Residue object is composed of three parts: the hetero field (hetfield),
the sequence identifier (resseq) and the insertion code (icode).</P><P>The hetero field is a string : it is &#X201C;W&#X201D; for waters, &#X201C;H_&#X201D; followed
by the residue name (e.g. &#X201C;H_FUC&#X201D;) for other hetero residues and blank
for standard amino and nucleic acids. This scheme is adopted for reasons described
in section <A HREF="#hetero probems">9.7.3.1</A>.</P><P>The second field in the Residue id is the sequence identifier, an integer describing
the position of the residue in the chain.</P><P>The third field is a string, consisting of the insertion code. The insertion
code is sometimes used to preserve a certain desirable residue numbering scheme.
A Ser 80 insertion mutant (inserted e.g. between a Thr 80 and an Asn 81 residue)
could e.g. have sequence identifiers and insertion codes as followed: Thr 80
A, Ser 80 B, Asn 81. In this way the residue numbering scheme stays in tune
with that of the wild type structure.</P><P>Let&#X2019;s give some examples. Asn 10 with a blank insertion code would have residue
id <TT>(&#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;, 10, &#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;)</TT>. Water 10 would have residue id <TT>(&#X2018;&#X2018;W&#X2018;&#X2018;, 10, &#X2018;&#X2018; &#X2018;&#X2018;)</TT>.
A glucose molecule (a hetero residue with residue name GLC) with sequence identifier
10 would have residue id <TT>(&#X2019;&#X2019;H_GLC&#X2019;&#X2019;, 10, &#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;)</TT>. In this way, the three
residues (with the same insertion code and sequence identifier) can be part
of the same chain because their residue id&#X2019;s are distinct.</P><P>In most cases, the hetflag and insertion code fields will be blank, e.g. <TT>(&#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;, 10, &#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;)</TT>.
In these cases, the sequence identifier can be used as a shortcut for the full
id:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim"># use full id

res10=chain[("", 10, "")]

# use shortcut

res10=chain[10]
</PRE><P>Each Residue object in a Chain object should have a unique id. However, disordered
residues are dealt with in a special way, as described in section <A HREF="#point mutations">9.7.2.3.2</A>.</P><P>A Residue object has a number of additional methods:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">r.get_resname()  # return residue name, e.g. "ASN"

</PRE><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">9.7.1.5&#XA0;&#XA0;Atom</H4><P>The Atom object stores the data associated with an atom, and has no children.
The id of an atom is its atom name (e.g. &#X201C;OG&#X201D; for the side chain oxygen
of a Ser residue). An Atom id needs to be unique in a Residue. Again, an exception
is made for disordered atoms, as described in section <A HREF="#disordered atoms">9.7.2.2</A>.</P><P>In a PDB file, an atom name consists of 4 chars, typically with leading and
trailing spaces. Often these spaces can be removed for ease of use (e.g. an
amino acid C &#X3B1;  atom is labeled &#X201C;.CA.&#X201D; in a PDB file, where
the dots represent spaces). To generate an atom name (and thus an atom id) the
spaces are removed, unless this would result in a name collision in a Residue
(i.e. two Atom objects with the same atom name and id). In the latter case,
the atom name including spaces is tried. This situation can e.g. happen when
one residue contains atoms with names &#X201C;.CA.&#X201D; and &#X201C;CA..&#X201D;, although
this is not very likely.</P><P>The atomic data stored includes the atom name, the atomic coordinates (including
standard deviation if present), the B factor (including anisotropic B factors

points of view. In general, we have tried to encapsulate all the complexity that
arises from disorder. If you just want to loop over all C &#X3B1;  atoms,
you do not care that some residues have a disordered side chain. On the other
hand it should also be possible to represent disorder completely in the data
structure. Therefore, disordered atoms or residues are stored in special objects
that behave as if there is no disorder. This is done by only representing a
subset of the disordered atoms or residues. Which subset is picked (e.g. which
of the two disordered OG side chain atom positions of a Ser residue is used)
can be specified by the user.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">9.7.2.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Disordered atoms<A NAME="disordered atoms"></A></H4><P>Disordered atoms are represented by ordinary Atom objects, but all Atom objects
that represent the same physical atom are stored in a DisorderedAtom object.
Each Atom object in a DisorderedAtom object can be uniquely indexed using its
altloc specifier. The DisorderedAtom object forwards all uncaught method calls
to the selected Atom object, by default the one that represents the atom with
with the highest occupancy. The user can of course change the selected Atom
object, making use of its altloc specifier. In this way atom disorder is represented
correctly without much additional complexity. In other words, if you are not
interested in atom disorder, you will not be bothered by it.</P><P>Each disordered atom has a characteristic altloc identifier. You can specify
that a DisorderedAtom object should behave like the Atom object associated with
a specific altloc identifier:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">atom.disordered\_select("A")  # select altloc A atom

print atom.get_altloc()
"A"

atom.disordered_select("B")     # select altloc B atom
print atom.get_altloc()
"B"
</PRE><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">9.7.2.3&#XA0;&#XA0;Disordered residues</H4><H5 CLASS="paragraph">9.7.2.3.1&#XA0;&#XA0;Common case</H5><P>The most common case is a residue that contains one or more disordered atoms.
This is evidently solved by using DisorderedAtom objects to represent the disordered
atoms, and storing the DisorderedAtom object in a Residue object just like ordinary
Atom objects. The DisorderedAtom will behave exactly like an ordinary atom (in
fact the atom with the highest occupancy) by forwarding all uncaught method
calls to one of the Atom objects (the selected Atom object) it contains.</P><H5 CLASS="paragraph">9.7.2.3.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Point mutations<A NAME="point mutations"></A></H5><P>A special case arises when disorder is due to a point mutation, i.e. when two
or more point mutants of a polypeptide are present in the crystal. An example
of this can be found in PDB structure 1EN2.</P><P>Since these residues belong to a different residue type (e.g. let&#X2019;s say Ser
60 and Cys 60) they should not be stored in a single Residue object as in the
common case. In this case, each residue is represented by one Residue object,
and both Residue objects are stored in a DisorderedResidue object.</P><P>The DisorderedResidue object forwards all uncaught methods to the selected Residue
object (by default the last Residue object added), and thus behaves like an
ordinary residue. Each Residue object in a DisorderedResidue object can be uniquely
identified by its residue name. In the above example, residue Ser 60 would have
id &#X201C;SER&#X201D; in the DisorderedResidue object, while residue Cys 60 would
have id &#X201C;CYS&#X201D;. The user can select the active Residue object in a DisorderedResidue
object via this id.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc106">9.7.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Hetero residues</H3><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">9.7.3.1&#XA0;&#XA0;Associated problems<A NAME="hetero probems"></A></H4><P>A common problem with hetero residues is that several hetero and non-hetero

seconds per structure. Parsing the structure of the large ribosomal subunit
(1FKK), which contains about 64000 atoms, takes 10 seconds on a 1000 MHz PC.</P><P>Three exceptions were generated in cases where an unambiguous data structure
could not be built. In all three cases, the likely cause is an error in the
PDB file that should be corrected. Generating an exception in these cases
is much better than running the chance of incorrectly describing
the structure in a data structure.</P><H5 CLASS="paragraph">9.7.5.1.1&#XA0;&#XA0;Duplicate residues</H5><P>One structure contains two amino acid residues in one chain with the same sequence
identifier (resseq 3) and icode. Upon inspection it was found that this chain
contains the residues Thr A3, &#X2026;, Gly A202, Leu A3, Glu A204. Clearly,
Leu A3 should be Leu A203. A couple of similar situations exist for structure
1FFK (which e.g. contains Gly B64, Met B65, Glu B65, Thr B67, i.e. residue Glu
B65 should be Glu B66).</P><H5 CLASS="paragraph">9.7.5.1.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Duplicate atoms</H5><P>Structure 1EJG contains a Ser/Pro point mutation in chain A at position 22.
In turn, Ser 22 contains some disordered atoms. As expected, all atoms belonging
to Ser 22 have a non-blank altloc specifier (B or C). All atoms of Pro 22 have
altloc A, except the N atom which has a blank altloc. This generates an exception,
because all atoms belonging to two residues at a point mutation should have
non-blank altloc. It turns out that this atom is probably shared by Ser and
Pro 22, as Ser 22 misses the N atom. Again, this points to a problem in the
file: the N atom should be present in both the Ser and the Pro residue, in both
cases associated with a suitable altloc identifier.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">9.7.5.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Automatic correction</H4><P>Some errors are quite common and can be easily corrected without much risk of

The GenePop file format is supported by a wide range of other population
genetic software applications, thus making it a relevant format in the
population genetics field.</P><P>Bio.PopGen provides a parser and generator of GenePop file format.
Utilities to manipulate the content of a record are also provided.
Here is an example on how to read a GenePop file (you can find
example GenePop data files in the Test/PopGen directory of Biopython):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.PopGen import GenePop

handle = open("example.gen")

</PRE><P>This will read a file called example.gen and parse it. If you
do print rec, the record will be output again, in GenePop format.</P><P>The most important information in rec will be the loci names and
population information (but there is more &#X2013; use help(GenePop.Record)
to check the API documentation). Loci names can be found on rec.loci_list.
Population information can be found on rec.populations.
Populations is a list with one element per population. Each element is itself
a list of individuals, each individual is a pair composed by individual
name and a list of alleles (2 per marker), here is an example for
rec.populations:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">[

Before showing more examples lets review the example above: We have
a list with one element (thus one chromosome), the chromosome is
a single instance (therefore not to be repeated), it is composed
of 24 SNPs, with a recombination rate of 0.0005 between each
consecutive SNP, the minimum frequency of the minor allele is
0.0 (i.e, it can be absent from a certain population).</P><P>Lets see a more complicated example:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">[
  (5, [
       ('SNP', [24, 0.0005, 0.0])
      ]
  ),
  (2, [
       ('DNA', [10, 0.0, 0.00005, 0.33]),

       ('MICROSAT', [1, 0.0, 0.001, 0.0, 0.0])
      ]
  )
]
</PRE><P>We start by having 5 chromosomes with the same structure as
above (i.e., 24 SNPs). We then have 2 chromosomes which
have a DNA sequence with 10 nucleotides, 0.0 recombination rate,
0.0005 mutation rate, and a transition rate of 0.33. Then we
have an RFLP with 0.0 recombination rate to the next locus and
a 0.0001 mutation rate. Finally we have a microsatellite (or STR),
with 0.0 recombination rate to the next locus (note, that as this
is a single microsatellite which has no loci following, this
recombination rate here is irrelevant), with a mutation rate
of 0.001, geometric paramater of 0.0 and a range constraint
of 0.0 (for information about this parameters please consult
the SIMCOAL2 documentation, you can use them to simulate
various mutation models, including the typical &#X2013; for microsatellites &#X2013;
stepwise mutation model among others).</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">9.8.2.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Running SIMCOAL2</H4><P>We now discuss how to run SIMCOAL2 from inside Biopython. It is required
that the binary for SIMCOAL2 is called simcoal2 (or simcoal2.exe on Windows
based platforms), please note that the typical name when downloading the
program is in the format simcoal2_x_y. As such renaming of the binary
after download is needed.</P><P>It is possible to run SIMCOAL2 on files that were not generated using the method
above (e.g., writing a parameter file by hand), but we will show an
example by creating a model using the framework presented above.</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.PopGen.SimCoal.Template import generate_simcoal_from_template

ctrl = SimCoalController('.')
ctrl.run_simcoal('simple_100_30.par', 50)
</PRE><P>The lines of interest are the last two (plus the new import).
Firstly a controller for the
application is created. The directory where the binary is located has
to be specified.</P><P>The simulator is then run on the last line: we know, from the rules explained
above, that the input file name is simple_100_30.par for the
simulation parameter file created. We then specify
that we want to run 50 independent simulations, by default Biopython
requests a simulation of diploid data, but a third parameter can
be added to simulate haploid data (adding as a parameter the
string &#X2019;0&#X2019;). SIMCOAL2 will now run (please
note that this can take quite a lot of time) and will create a directory
with the simulation results. The results can now be analysed (typically
studying the data with Arlequin3). In the future Biopython might support
reading the Arlequin3 format and thus allowing for the analysis of SIMCOAL2
data inside Biopython.</P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc113">9.8.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Other applications</H3><P>Here we discuss interfaces and utilities to deal with population genetics&#X2019;
applications which arguably have a smaller user base.</P><H4 CLASS="subsubsection">9.8.3.1&#XA0;&#XA0;FDist: Detecting selection and molecular adaptation</H4><P>FDist is a selection detection application suite based on computing
(i.e. simulating) a &#X201C;neutral&#X201D; confidence interval based on <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> and
heterozygosity. Markers (which can be SNPs, microsatellites, AFLPs
among others) which lie outside the &#X201C;neutral&#X201D; interval are to be
considered as possible candidates for being under selection.</P><P>FDist is mainly used when the number of markers is considered enough
to estimate an average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB>, but not enough to either have outliers
calculated from the dataset directly or, with even more markers for
which the relative positions in the genome are known, to use
approaches based on, e.g., Extended Haplotype Heterozygosity (EHH).</P><P>The typical usage pattern for FDist is as follows:</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">

(for this example to work FDist binaries have to be on the
executable PATH).</P><P>The FDist data format is application specific and is not used at
all by other applications, as such you will probably have to convert
your data for use with FDist. Biopython can help you do this.
Here is an example converting from GenePop format to FDist format
(along with imports that will be needed on examples further below):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.PopGen import GenePop

</PRE><P>In this code we simply parse a GenePop file and convert it to a FDist
record.</P><P>Printing an FDist record will generate
a string that can be directly saved to a file and supplied to FDist. FDist
requires the input file to be called infile, therefore we save the record on
a file with that name.</P><P>The most important fields on a FDist record are: num_pops, the number of
populations; num_loci, the number of loci and loci_data with the marker
data itself. Most probably the details of the record are of no interest
to the user, as the record only purpose is to be passed to FDist.</P><P>The next step is to calculate the average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> of the dataset (along
with the sample size):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">ctrl = Controller.FDistController()

the third the average and the fourth the upper bound. This can

the simulation, which is the next step...</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">pv_data = ctrl.run_pv()
</PRE><P>You can only call cplot after having run datacal and fdist.</P><P>This will use the simulated markers to assess the status of each

that is on the FDist record (which is in the same order that the GenePop
record) is returned. Each element in the list is a quadruple, the
fundamental member of each quadruple is the last element (regarding the
other elements, please refer to the pv documentation &#X2013; for the

Higher values would indicate a stronger candidate for positive selection,

a possible neutral marker. What is &#X201C;higher&#X201D;, &#X201C;lower&#X201D; or &#X201C;intermediate&#X201D;
is really a subjective issue, but taking a &#X201C;confidence interval&#X201D; approach
