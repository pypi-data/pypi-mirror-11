Ideas / TODO

The most pressing issues can be found in the issue tracker on Github.

* Make Pyro support listening to multiple network interfaces at the same time (and returning the correct URI from the daemon. Name server is harder...)
* add multiprocess server (forking?) based on multiprocessing?
* concurrency strategies in the daemon? (reentrant, single)
* Pyro-over-SSH (not SSL/TLS) using Paramiko?
