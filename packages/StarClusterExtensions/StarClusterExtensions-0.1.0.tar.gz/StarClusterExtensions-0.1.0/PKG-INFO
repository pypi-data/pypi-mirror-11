        ===================
        
        To install:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          git clone git@github.com:egafni/StarClusterExtensions.git
          cd StarClusterExtensions
          pip install .
        
        Then add the plugins to your starcluster config.  See the file `example_starcluster_config` for my setup.
        The 'erik' and 'billing' plugins are not necessary.  Use an m1.large node or larger, even for testing.
        
        .. note::
          
          Requires development version (.999) of starcluster, which is not automatically installed by pip.  Install starcluster from its development branch manually.
