# pyrecommend

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/dan-passaro/pyrecommend.svg?branch=master)

This project is for now a personal sandbox as I read through some literature on
collabroative filtering and automated recommendations. This may perhaps one day
become a library for general use but right now it is not fit for... well
anything, really.

To run the test suite, `pip install tox` then run the command `tox`.
