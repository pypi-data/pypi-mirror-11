Description: Jython Swing Utilities
        ======================
        
        A collection of utility classes and helper functions to make it easier to build
        Swing user interfaces with Jython. The helpers provide "pythonic" alternatives
        to often clumsy Java APIs.
        
        Included in this package:
        
        * enhanced table, list and combobox models
        * JavaBeans support and automatic property change notification
        * an alternative API for adding/removing event listeners
        * a powerful data binding system that supports Swing components
        * preferences access
        * text field formatters
        * shortcuts for loading resources (images or generic data) via class loaders
        * shortcuts for basic dialogs
        * enhanced file selection dialogs
        * wrappers for loading `JFormDesigner`_ forms
        * decorators and functions for safely accessing the GUI from any thread
        * support for running background tasks in separate threads
        
        Requires Jython 2.7 or later.
        
        Documentation can be found at the Python Packaging
        `documentation repository`_.

        Building jar files
        ------------------
        
        To build a jar file, you need to tell ant where to find jython.jar, by
        defining the ``jythonjarpath`` property, either as a command line option
        to ant, or in the ``build.properties`` file.
        
        To build a jar file containing the Python source files::
        
            ant srcjar
        
        To build a jar containing compiled bytecode files::
        
            ant binjar
        
        
        Building signed jar files
        -------------------------
        
        Signing the jar files requires three additional properties to be defined:
        ``signer``, ``storepass`` and ``keypass``. It also requires that you have a
        matching code signing key in your keystore (``~/.keystore``).
        
        
        To build a signed source jar::
        
            ant signsrcjar
        
        To build a signed, compiled jar (suitable for `Java Web Start`_)::
            
            ant signbinjar
        
        The generated jar file will be timestamped using Safe Creative's `free
        timestamping`_ service. If you want to use a different timestamping authority,
        you can override the ``tsaurl`` property in your own ``build.properties``
        file.
