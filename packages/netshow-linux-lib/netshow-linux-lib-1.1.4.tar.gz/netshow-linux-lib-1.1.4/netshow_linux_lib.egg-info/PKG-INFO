Description: netshow-linux
        =============
        
        Netshow-linux is a Provider for
        `Netshow <http://github.com/CumulusNetworks/netshow-core>`__, a Network
        Abstraction Software. It is optimized to collect core networking data
        from Linux devices that contain many interfaces.
        
        Netshow-linux has 2 main modules.
        
        netshowlib
        ----------
        
        This module contains other modules that are responsible for retrieving
        network information from the Linux kernel and associated components.
        This information is abstracted in mainly into interface types, like
        bonds, bridges, bond members and so on.
        
        netshow
        -------
        
        Netshow modules are responsible for printing the network information
        collected from the ``netshowlib`` modules. For example, the
        ``print_iface`` netshow module takes interface information retrieved by
        ``netshowlib`` modules and abstracted in python objects and prints the
        information in a human readable form.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Netshow is available on Pypi.python.org. Use the newish PIP version like 7.0+ and run
