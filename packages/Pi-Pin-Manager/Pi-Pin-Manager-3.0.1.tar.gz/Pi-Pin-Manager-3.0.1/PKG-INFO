        ==============
        
        Boilerplate code is annoying and sometimes there can be a lot of it working with Raspberry Pi
        GPIO (RPi.GPIO). I got tired of setting the board mode and declaring GPIO channels in every
        script so I made a library that uses a config file instead. In addition to getting rid of the
        boilerplate, **Pi-Pin-Manager** offers a cleaner interface for working with RPi.GPIO.
