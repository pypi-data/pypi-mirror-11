Description: Overview
        ========
        
        named_bitfield lets you define fixed width bit fields within an integer, and
        address those fields as class attributes, while still providing access to the
        backing integer representation.  The original use case for this is
        "intellignet IDs".  Essentially, this is a unique numeric id, sutiable for use
        as a database primary key, which encodes some information about the object it
        identifies.  Obviously, this should be immutable information so your IDs don't
        change or (worse) get out of sync with reality.  Some suggestions are the
        object type, the create time, or the data source.  Saving a few bits for a
        serial counter is also advisable, as timestamps aren't reliable as unique ids.
