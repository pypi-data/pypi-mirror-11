Authentication Module for django rest auth

Knox provides easy to use authentication for `Django REST
Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`__ The aim is to allow
for common patterns in applications that are REST based, with little
extra effort; and to ensure that connections remain secure.

Knox Authentication is token based, similar to the
``TokenAuthentication`` built in to DRF. However, it overcomes some
problems present in the default implementation:

-  DRF Tokens are generated with ``os.urandom``, which is not
   cryptographically secure.

Knox uses OpenSSL to provide tokens. - DRF tokens are limitted to one
per user. This does not facilitate securely signing in from multiple
devices, as the token is shared. It also requires *all* devices to be
logged out if a server-side logout is required (i.e. the token is
deleted).

Knox provides one token per call to the login view - allowing each
client to have its own token which is deleted on the server side when
the client logs out.

Knox also provides an option for a logged in client to remove *all*
tokens that the server has - forcing all clients to re-authenticate.

Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knox depends on ``cryptography`` to provide bindings to ``OpenSSL`` for
token generation This requires the OpenSSL build libraries to be
available.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Cryptography is a statically linked build, no extra steps are needed

Linux
^^^^^

``cryptography`` should build very easily on Linux provided you have a C
compiler, headers for Python (if youâ€™re not using ``pypy``), and headers
for the OpenSSL and ``libffi`` libraries available on your system.

Debian and Ubuntu:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev python-dev

Fedora and RHEL-derivatives:

.. code:: bash

    sudo yum install gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel

For other systems or problems, see the `cryptography installation
docs <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/>`__

Installing Knox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knox should be installed with pip

.. code:: bash

    pip install django-rest-knox

add ``rest_framework`` and ``knox`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
      ...
      rest_framework,
      knox,
      ...
    )

Remember to apply the migrations for the models

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py migrate

Usage
-----

Views
~~~~~

Knox achieves most of its functionality through three views. These can
easily be included via your url config:

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
      #...snip...
      url(r'api/auth/', include('knox.urls'))
      #...snip...
    ]

**N.B.** it is important to use the string syntax and not try to import
``knox.urls``, as the reference to the ``User`` model will cause the app
to fail at import time.

The views would then acessible as:

-  ``/api/auth/login`` -> ``LoginView``
-  ``/api/auth/logout`` -> ``LogoutView``
-  ``/api/auth/logoutall`` -> ``LogoutAllView``

they can also be looked up by name:

.. code:: python

    reverse('knox_login')
    reverse('knox_logout')
    reverse('knox_logoutall')

LoginView
^^^^^^^^^

This view accepts only a post request with an empty body.

The LoginView accepts the same sort of authentication as your Rest
Framework ``DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES`` setting. If this is not
set, it defaults to ``(SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication)``.

LoginView was designed to work well with Basic authentication, or
similar schemes.

When it receives an authenticated request, it will return json -
``user`` an object representing the user that was authenticated -
``token`` the token that should be used for other requests

LogoutView
^^^^^^^^^^

This view accepts only a post request with an empty body. It responds to
Knox Token Authentication. On a successful request, the token used to
authenticate is deleted from the system and can no longer be used to
authenticate.

LogoutAllView
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This view accepts only a post request with an empty body. It responds to
Knox Token Authentication. On a successful request, the token used to
authenticate, and *all other tokens* registered to the same ``User``
account, are deleted from the system and can no longer be used to
authenticate.

Authentication Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knox provides one class for authentication - ``TokenAuthentication``
This works in using `DRF's authentication
system <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/>`__.

Knox tokens should be generated using the provided views. Any
``APIView`` or ``ViewSet`` can be accessed using these tokens by adding
``TokenAuthentication`` to the View's ``authentication_classes``. To
authenticate, the ``Authorization`` header should be set on the request,
with a value of the word 'Token', then a space, then the authentication
token provided by ``LoginView``.

Example:

.. code:: python

    from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
    from rest_framework.response import Response
    from rest_framework.views import APIView

    from knox.auth import TokenAuthentication

    class ExampleView(APIView):
        authentication_classes = (TokenAuthentication,)
        permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)

        def get(self, request, format=None):
            content = {
                'foo': 'bar'
            }
            return Response(content)

Example auth header:

.. code:: javascript

    Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b9836F45E23A345
