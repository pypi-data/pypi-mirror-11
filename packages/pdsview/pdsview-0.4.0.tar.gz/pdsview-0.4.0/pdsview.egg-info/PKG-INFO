        Features
        --------
        
        * NASA PDS Image Viewer
        
        NOTE: This is alpha quality software.  It lacks many features and lacks support
        for many PDS image types.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        On OS X you must first install the Qt UI toolkit using Homebrew
        (http://brew.sh/).  After installing Homebrew, issue the following command::
        
            brew install qt
        
        Create a new virtual environment, install the `pdsview` module with pip,
        and setup the PySide environment::
        
            mkvirtualenv pdsview
            pip install pdsview
            pyside_postinstall.py -install
        
        Now you should be able to run the `pdsview` program.
        
        This works on Linux as well (Ubuntu 14.04).  Instructions coming soon.
        Installing the proper Qt dev package and running `pyside_postinstall.py`
        in a similar fashion should work.
