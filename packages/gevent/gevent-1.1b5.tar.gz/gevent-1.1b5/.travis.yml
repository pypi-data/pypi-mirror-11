    # Bug https://bitbucket.org/pypa/wheel/issues/146/wheel-building-fails-on-cpython-350b3
    # means that installing cython on cpython 3.5 cannot use the wheel cache, which
    # means that the LINT=true case is quite slow (2.5 minutes). If this takes very long to fix,
    # we might want to do some refactoring to move installation into the makefile or a script (so the LINT=true case
    # isn't slowed down).
    # That was fixed in wheel 0.25, but now we're hitting https://bitbucket.org/pypa/wheel/issues/148/unorderable-types-error-for-python-3
