Description: ====================
        collective.subsitebehaviors
        ====================
        
        Features:
        ---------
        
        Appearance customization for Dexterity types:
        
        - logo applicable to any INavigationRoot, scaled using 'logo' scale if found
        - end-user-friendly TTW-customizable CSS styling applicable to any INavigationRoot
        
        Credits:
        --------
        
        - viewlets originally copied from ftw.subsite
        - inspiration from various subsite packages
        
        How to use:
        -----------
        
        - apply behavior to your content types as you wish
        
        To define further appearance customization besides the logo, add 'styling fields to your
        Dexterity type:
        
        - field ids must start with the prefix "css_"
        - css selector is encoded into field id as tag[tagname]_id[id]_class[classname]
        - the CSS style can then be normally entered as the field value in the add / edit form
        
        Here, only the tag value is mandatory, id & class are optional.
        
        - optional css attribute name is encoded likewise as _cssattr[AttrName] suffix
        
        Here, because Dexterity field names cannot contain dash (ie. '-') characters, the
        CamelCase notation is used (as in 'AttrName', above). So for example background-color
        css attribute is specified 'BackgroundColor'.
        
        If there is no css attribute name found in the field id, it is assumed the field value
        contains a full regular 'attribute: value' css style statement, without the ending
        semicolon.
        
        An example:
        
        All this may sound complex at first sight, but it's really not- to define a custom
        background color for your content, just add a Dexterity field whose id is
        'css_tagbody_cssattrBackgroundColor'.
