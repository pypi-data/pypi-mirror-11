    # edit a gist
    gister file.txt

    # add a new file
    gister -e o4j208j20fj20f3j file2.txt

usage
~~~~~

NOTE! all gists are now secret

::

    usage: gister [-h] [-a] [-c COMMAND] [-d DESCRIPTION] [-e id/url] [-p] [-v]
                  [files [files ...]]

    make gists!

    positional arguments:
      files                 name of file(s) to gist

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a, --anonymous       gist will be anonymous even if you have oauth
                            configured
      -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                            command to prepend to gist
      -d DESCRIPTION, --description DESCRIPTION
                            description of the gist
      -e id/url, --edit id/url
                            edit a gist identified by id or url
      -p, --private         put gist on configured enterprise github
      -v, --vim             gist came from vim, no prompt/history

usage - editing gists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

editing gists works as such: \* any files gisted with the ``-e`` flag
will be added to the gist unless a file already exists in the gist by
that name, in which case it will be overwritten with the current file's
contents \* piping to a gist (ex ``echo wahoo | gister``) will always
result in the output of the original command being stored in a file
called ``gistfile1.txt``. if you edit the gist by piping something new
to it, the previous gistfile1.txt will be overwritten \* there is no way
to delete certain files in a gist using gister \* if gister is invoked
using the ``-e`` flag and an nbviewer url is shown,
``?flush_cache=true`` will be appended to the url

usage - ipython notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ipython notebooks are files with a ``.ipynb`` extension. if all files
specified on the commandline have this extension, a link to the
http://nbviewer.ipython.org url to display your gist will be generated
as well. nbviewer does not store your gist's data permanently, but does
cache it for ~10 minutes

also note that an nbviewer url will not be generated with the
``-p/--private`` flag as it would be impossible for it to access the
gist

install
~~~~~~~

``pip install gister`` or clone the repo and ``python setup.py install``

if you get an ``InsecurePlatformWarning``,
``pip install requests[security]`` to solve it. I had to install
libffi-devel on my fedora 21 system to get pyOpenSSL rocking

config file - .gister
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

an example configuration file ``.gister`` is given for you to use. it
will be looked for in ``~/.gister``. it supports these values:

-  public\_oauth - your public github oauth token (not necessary for
   anonymous gists)
-  private\_oauth - your private github oauth token (if you plan on
   using private github) (not necessary for anonymous gists)
-  prompt - configure prompt that is displayed when using the
   ``-c/--command`` option
-  public\_github\_url - this defaults to the url for public github
-  private\_github\_url - if you plan on using ``-p/--private`` this url
   needs to be set to the location of your private github deployment

github oauth tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

gister can be used with no oauth tokens, but can only create anonymous
gists by specifying the ``-a`` or ``--anonymous`` flags

all gists will fall back to anonymous posting if you don't have oauth
configured for the endpoint being used

you can manage your github oauth tokens here by visiting
`applications <https://github.com/settings/applications>`__ in your
account settings

you can also create an oauth token using the github api as I did in this
`gist <http://gist.github.com/4482201>`__

keyring
~~~~~~~

use of `keyring <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring>`__ is optional. it
allows you store your oauth tokens in a safer place than the
``~/.gister`` config file

if you wish to use keyring, specify your ``public_oauth`` and/or
``public_oauth`` tokens as follows:

::

    [gister]
    private_oauth = KEYRING
    public_oauth = KEYRING

gister will look for a section called *gister* with keys *public\_oauth*
and/or *private\_oauth* containing a github oauth tokens linked to your
public github and/or private github account. an
`example <https://gist.github.com/4481060>`__ of adding keys to python
keyring

using with vim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I added the following to `my
.vimrc <http://github.com/tr3buchet/conf/blob/master/.vimrc>`__ to
interact with gister:

::

    " ------- gist making! --------------------------------
    fun Gister(...)
      let gister_call = "gister -v"
      for flag in a:000
        let gister_call = gister_call . " " . flag
      endfor
      let result = system(gister_call, expand("%:t") . "\n" . getreg("\""))
      echo result
    endfun
    " secret gist on public github from selection or single line
    vnoremap <F9> y:call Gister()<cr>
    nnoremap <F9> yy:call Gister()<cr>

    " secret gist on private github from selection or single line
    vnoremap <F10> y:call Gister("-p")<cr>
    nnoremap <F10> yy:call Gister("-p")<cr>
    " ------- end pastie.org ---------------------------
