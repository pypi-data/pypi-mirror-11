Description: pyhacrf
        =======
        
        Hidden alignment conditional random field for classifying string pairs -
        a learnable edit distance.
        
        This package aims to implement the HACRF machine learning model with a
        ``sklearn``-like interface. It includes ways to fit a model to training
        examples and score new example.
        
        The model takes string pairs as input and classify them into any number
        of classes. In McCallum's original paper the model was applied to the
        database deduplication problem. Each database entry was paired with
        every other entry and the model then classified whether the pair was a
        'match' or a 'mismatch' based on training examples of matches and
        mismatches.
        
        I also tried to use it as learnable string edit distance for normalizing
        noisy text. See *A Conditional Random Field for Discriminatively-trained
        Finite-state String Edit Distance* by McCallum, Bellare, and Pereira,
        and the report *Conditional Random Fields for Noisy text normalisation*
        by Dirko Coetsee.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from pyhacrf import StringPairFeatureExtractor, Hacrf
        
            training_X = [('helloooo', 'hello'), # Matching examples
                          ('h0me', 'home'),
                          ('krazii', 'crazy'),
                          ('non matching string example', 'no really'), # Non-matching examples
                          ('and another one', 'yep')]
            training_y = ['match',
                          'match',
                          'match',
                          'non-match',
                          'non-match']
        
            # Extract features
            feature_extractor = StringPairFeatureExtractor(match=True, numeric=True)
            training_X_extracted = feature_extractor.fit_transform(training_X)
        
            # Train model
            model = Hacrf(l2_regularization=1.0)
            model.fit(training_X_extracted, training_y)
        
            # Evaluate
            from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
            predictions = model.predict(training_X_extracted)
        
            print(confusion_matrix(y, predictions))
            > array([[3, 0],
            >        [1, 1]])
        
            print(model.predict_proba(training_X_extracted))
            > [[ 0.21914828  0.78085172]
            >  [ 0.30629073  0.69370927]
            >  [ 0.36365022  0.63634978]
            >  [ 0.40832083  0.59167917]
            >  [ 0.51091745  0.48908255]]
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This package depends on ``numpy``. The LBFGS optimizer in ``pylbfgs`` is
        used, but alternative optimizers can be passed.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Install by running:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        or from pypi:
