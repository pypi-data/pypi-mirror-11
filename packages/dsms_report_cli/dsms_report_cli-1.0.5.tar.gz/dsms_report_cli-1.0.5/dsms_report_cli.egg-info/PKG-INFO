Description: DSMS Report CLI tool
        --------------------
        
        dsms-report-cli is a command line interface for exporting reports from a DSMS
        system.
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``pip install dsms-report-cli``
        
        ========
        Setup
        ========
        
        Before you'll begin, you'll need several settings set as environment variables:
        
        DSMS_SERVER    (e.g. https://mydsmsserver)
        DSMS_USER      (e.g. tom)
        DSMS_PASS      (e.g. ThisIsMyPassword)
        
        =========
        Running reports
        =========
        
        To see all command line switches, you can run::
        
            dsms_report --help
        
        You can also run searches of DSMS results using the same filter syntax as the
        web application. For example, to get all active phishing targets, run::
        
            dsms_report --query="status:Active type:Phishing"
        
        =========
        Report formats
        =========
        
        Reports are generated by Jinja2 templates. If you'd like to add new types of
        reports, you can place these in a separate directory and tell dsms_report where
        to find these using ``dsms_report --template_dir=[your custom templates]``.
