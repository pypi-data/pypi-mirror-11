DSMS Report CLI tool
--------------------

dsms-report-cli is a command line interface for exporting reports from a DSMS
system.

============
Installation
============

``pip install dsms-report-cli``

========
Setup
========

Before you'll begin, you'll need several settings set as environment variables:

DSMS_SERVER    (e.g. https://mydsmsserver)
DSMS_USER      (e.g. tom)
DSMS_PASS      (e.g. ThisIsMyPassword)

=========
Running reports
=========

To see all command line switches, you can run::

    dsms_report --help

You can also run searches of DSMS results using the same filter syntax as the
web application. For example, to get all active phishing targets, run::

    dsms_report --query="status:Active type:Phishing"

=========
Report formats
=========

Reports are generated by Jinja2 templates. If you'd like to add new types of
reports, you can place these in a separate directory and tell dsms_report where
to find these using ``dsms_report --template_dir=[your custom templates]``.
