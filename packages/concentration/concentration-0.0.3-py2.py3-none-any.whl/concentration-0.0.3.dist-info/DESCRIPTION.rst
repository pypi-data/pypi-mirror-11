Concentration
=============

Stay focused on work when you want, and goof off when you don't.
Concentration is a simple console utility to block distracting sites
when you need to focus, while allowing you to easily take timed breaks.

Installing Concentration
========================

::

    pip install concentration

Using Concentration
===================

To keep focused (blocking distracting sites):

::

    sudo concentration improve

To take a small one minute timed break:

::

    sudo concentration break

To access all sites:

::

    sudo concentration lose

Configuring Concentration
=========================

You can add more files to the blocked list by putting them in the
following files (new line delimited): - ~/.concentration.distractors -
/etc/concentration.distractors

Thanks and I hope you find concentration useful in your effort to get
more done!
