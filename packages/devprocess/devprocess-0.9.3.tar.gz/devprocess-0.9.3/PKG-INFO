Description: JIRA Command Line Tool
        =======================
        
        This tool provides the capability to quickly react to issues found in a Production environment.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Download and install Python 2.7.10 if it is not already available and run::
        
            > pip install devprocess
        
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        When running the first time setup defaults by::
        
            > devproc config <jira-username> <jira-password> <jira-project-name> <jira-agile-board-name>
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Report a Bug
        ------------
        When a new "Blocker" high priority Bug is encountered in the Production environment enter::
        
            > devproc blocker "Details of issue encountered in Component X which will be added to the jira issue summary"
            Bug TE-8 created and assigned a priority of "Blocker"
            This needs to be triage immediately. For help with triage enter:
            devproc triage --help
        
        This will create a Bug and set:
        
        * Project: <jira-project-name> (from the config above)
        * Priority: Blocker
        
        Triage
        ------
        
        To Triage this ticket enter::
        
            > devproc triage TE-8 5 arahim
            Issue TE-8 Triaged successfully
        
        This will triage issue TE-8 by setting:
        * Story Points: 5
        * Assignee: arahim
        * Epic Link: [Ongoing] Production Bugs (This is the default setting. To change it look at "devproc config --help")
        * Sprint: <Current Active Sprint> (If there is not active sprint this will not be set)
