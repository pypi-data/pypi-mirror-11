Description: describe it
        ===========
        
        |buildstatus|_
        
        Describe-it is a nose plugin that allows you to write unit tests that are more
        like executable examples of how a component should work than just being tests.
        
        The other benefit is the ability to describe how a component behaves in certain
        contexts, where one context may build on a previously defined context by using
        nesting.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install describe-it
        
        Writing
        -------
        Any module that ends with 'spec' is considered to contain specifications/tests
        for describe_it.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ vim myfirst_spec.py
        
        ...and the content:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from game import Game
            from describe_it import describe, it, before_each, Fixture
        
            @describe                                               # This declares a test context.
            def a_game():
                f = Fixture()                                       # Fixture is a hack to get around
                                                                    # Python's implementation of closures.
                                                                    # You can use other methods, such as
