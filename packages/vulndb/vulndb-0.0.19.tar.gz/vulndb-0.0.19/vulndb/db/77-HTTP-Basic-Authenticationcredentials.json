    "Basic Access Authentication is an authentication method which uses base64 encoding",
    "and transmits login credentials in cleartext between a server and client. This is",
    "considered insecure because credentials are transmitted over unencrypted channels",
    "which makes it vulnerable to network eavesdropping attacks. Furthermore, base64",
    "encoding is considered weak because it can be easily decoded to reveal the original",
    "content.\n\nIf an application requires authentication, it will send a `WWW-Authenticate`",
    "header with a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code. Then, the client will need to send",
    "the server credentials through an `Authorization` header. The credentials are transmitted", 
    "as a 'name:password' string format in the header.A well-positioned attacker can capture",
    "the usernames and passwords by sniffing traffic coming to these services."

      "Other methods of authentication, like cookie based authentication must be",
	  "used as a replacement. This can still be considered insecure if credentials are",
      "submitted in clear text. TLS Encryption must be used when transmitting sensitive",
      "information."
