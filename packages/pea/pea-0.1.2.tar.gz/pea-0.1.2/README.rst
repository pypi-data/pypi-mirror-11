pea - The tiniest green vegetable.
-------------------------------------

**pea** is a minimal BDD framework for python, in the style of ruby's `cucumber`_ and
python's `lettuce`_. It aims to help you write the same kind of tests - but in straight-up
python code, without all the parsing and indirection and other hoops to jump through. It's
a lot like ruby's `coulda`_.

Benefits of cucumber-style testing include:

- You write your tests in clear, english language without inline code
- Your tests are human-readable, and hopefully human-editable
- You can re-use steps with confidence, because they all do exactly what
  they say on the tin

Benefits of ``pea`` over ``lettuce``, ``cucumber``, etc:

- It's a really trivial library (thus the name). It doesn't do very much,
  so it probably doesn't have many bugs
  
- Your features are just python code:
  
  - No "BDD language parser" needed
  - No regular expressions
  - Stack traces make sense
  - Syntax highlighting
  - You can use `ctags`_ to jump between test & implementation, as well as
    for method completion
  - Managing and renaming functions is much easier than managing regexes
  - You can use whatever abstractions you like
  - You can use rich python objects as arguments, instead of parsing strings
     
- It doesn't need its own test runner; so you can just use `nose`_ to run it
  alongside your unit tests


So how do I use it?
--------------------------------------

Here's a minimal example::

	from pea import *

	@step
	def I_go_to_the_store():
		world.location='store'
		world.cart = []
	
	@step
	def I_buy_some(item):
		world.cart.append(item)

	@step
	def I_go_home():
		world.location = 'home'
	
	@step
	def I_have_some_delicious(item):
		assert item in world.cart
		world.assertEquals(world.location, 'home')

	# --------------------

	class TestShopping(TestCase):
		def test_buying_some_peas(self):
			
			Given.I_go_to_the_store()
			When.I_buy_some('peas')
			And.I_go_home()
			Then.I_have_some_delicious('peas')

... and when you run it (with nosetests, in verbose mode):

Typically you would put your steps in a separate python module (or many),
but it's your choice.

Basics:
^^^^^^^

- ``@step`` adds your function to pea's registry of steps, which allows
  them to be called via ``Given``, ``When``, ``And``, and ``Then``.
- To re-use a step from inside another step, just call the function!

Stuff to remember:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Make sure you inherit from ``pea.TestCase`` (and call ``super`` from ``setUp``/``tearDown``),
  as it takes care of resetting the ``world`` between tests.
- You can use ``TestCase`` assertion methods on the world, too
  - e.g. ``world.assertEquals(expected, actual)``

Pea works well with `rednose`_
