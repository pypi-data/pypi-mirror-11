#
# The latest happenings in Slackware development can be seen by looking 
# at the ChangeLogs in the various distribution trees. For your bleeding 
# edge enjoyment, we are providing the ChangeLogs for the -current 
# development tree as well as the latest stable release on the web site. 
# The latest ChangeLogs can always be found on ftp://ftp.slackware.com We 
# are updating this page every two hours, so they will remain fairly 
# current. But the truly bleeding edge will want to leave an ftp session 
# open to ftp://ftp.slackware.com and less the ChangeLog every 5 minutes.
#
# You may not have to be changed here.
