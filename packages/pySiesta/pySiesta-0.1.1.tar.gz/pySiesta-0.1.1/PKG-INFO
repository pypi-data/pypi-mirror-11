        ===========
        
        pySiesta provides a tool to work with siesta package within a Python script. You might find
        it most useful for tasks involving input generation. Typical usage
        often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from pySiesta import location
            from towelstuff import utils
        
            if utils.has_towel():
                print "Your towel is located:", location.where_is_my_towel()
        
        (Note the double-colon and 4-space indent formatting above.)
        
        Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
        and ``monospace`` look like this.
        
        
        A Section
        =========
        
        Lists look like this:
        
        * First
        
        * Second. Can be multiple lines
          but must be indented properly.
        
        A Sub-Section
        -------------
        
        Numbered lists look like you'd expect:
        
        1. hi there
        
        2. must be going
        
        Urls are http://like.this and links can be
        written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
