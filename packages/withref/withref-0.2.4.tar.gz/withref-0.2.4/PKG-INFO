        ``withref`` makes Python's ``with`` statement able to simplify complex
        dereferences. This is what I initially, naively thought the statement was
        for, similar to the ``with`` statement of half-remembered Pascal.
        
        The typical Python use is a more complex guard over the entry and exit
        points for using an object. See e.g. `this effbot article
        <http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm>`_, But ``withref`` makes
        the simpler "just give me the dereferenced object, please" use case work as
        well.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            from withref import ref
            from stuf import stuf
        
            # stuf used for demonstration purposes only. Convenient way to
            # make dict entries accessible as dot-deferenceable properties.
        
            a = stuf({ 'b': { 'c': { 'c1': 1 }, 'd': 44.1 } })
        
            with ref(a.b.c) as c:
                c.c1 = 99
        
            print a
            a_ideal = stuf({'b': {'c': {'c1': 99}, 'd': 44.1}})
            assert a == a_ideal
        
        It works with array-style references too, of course::
        
            with ref(a['b']['c']) as cc:
                c['c1'] = 99
        
            assert a == a_ideal
        
        But beware OVER-dereferencing! While this works correctly::
        
            with ref(a.b.c.c1) as c1:
                print c1
                assert c1 == 99
        
        This does NOT::
        
            with ref(a.b.c.c1) as c1:
                c1 = 12345
                assert c1 == 12345
        
            assert a.b.c.c1 == 99   # with heavy heart
                                    # because we just ostensibly set it to 12345
        
        Unlike Pascal, ``ref`` is not built into the language proper. And unlike Perl,
        Python is less eager to provide `lvalues
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)#lrvalue>`_ for every
        mention of a variable or value. As a result, ``ref`` can provide the *value*
        of the full-deferenced ``c1``, but not the assignable *lvalue*.
        
        Like Pascal's ``with``, ``ref`` removes N-1 layers of the enclosing structure
        for values, but only N-2 for assignment. Still, in complex multi-layer
        structures, this can be a nice simplification::
        
            with ref(app.config.server.wsgi) as wsgi:
                wsgi.logger = some_logger
                wsgi.debug_level = 4
                wsgi.port = 8080
        
        arguably beats::
        
            app.config.server.wsgi.logger = some_logger
            app.config.server.wsgi.debug_level = 4
            app.config.server.wsgi.port = 8080
        
        for simplicity and clarity.
        
        I see a lot of configuration code that constantly repeats the same long
        multi-level dereferences. That style is repetitive (anti-DRY) and tends to
        left-align code blocks, both of which impede program comprehension. Using the
        ``with`` statement is a neat way to simplify and at the same time add a little extra
        visual structure.
        
        And while assignment ("lvalue production") isn't always possible, there still are
        some interesting tricks possible with simple value production::
        
            with ref("this is a string"[0:4]) as t:
                print t
        
        Alternative
        ===========
        
        While ``yadda.yadda.yadda`` referencing is all too common, one can also
        use a more proximate variable assignment::
        
            wsgi = app.config.server.wsgi
            wsgi.logger = some_logger
            wsgi.debug_level = 4
            wsgi.port = 8080
        
        This lacks the more indented structure of the ``withref`` approach, but
        is still much preferable to what you often find in the field.
        
        See Also
        ========
        
        The `withhacks <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/withhacks>`_ module, which includes
        many other fun hacks (multi-line lambdas, new looping structures, etc.)--but
        also requires the `byteplay <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/byteplay>`_ module which
        actively introspects & munges Python bytecode ("Danger, Will Robinson!
        Danger!"), and has not been updated to work beyond Python 2.6.
        
        Possible Future Extension
        =========================
        
        As ``withhacks`` shows, using introspection we could determine the lvalue of
        the calling object even in the edge-case where it is a leaf-node of its
        enclosing structure. This would not require any bytecode changes, and should
        be compatible with modern versions of Python (e.g. 2.7.x and 3.x).
        
        Whether that trick can be done simply, portably, rock-solid reliably, and
        transparently enough to satisfy those who code the modules that tend to most
        need this kind of dereferencing simplification--i.e. complex modules often
        used in production settings, into which they are understandably loathe to
        introduce any possible sources of error or any performance impedance--that
        is the key open question.

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install or upgrade to the latest version::
        
            pip install -U withref
        
        To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::
        
            python3.3 -m easy_install --upgrade withref
        
        (You may need to prefix these with ``sudo`` to authorize
        installation. In environments without super-user privileges, you may want to
        use ``pip``'s ``--user`` option, to install only for a single user, rather
        than system-wide.)
