        Funny Scripts for Exploratory Data Analysis
        
        In every Data Science project some EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) must be done. This commonly requires the creation of a bunch of standard charts, that are fully determined by the variable types (i.e. numerical, categorical, timestamps, and so on). In this project we intend to add some scripts to automagikally detect data types and create a bunch of useful graphs in order to facilitate quick data exploration.
        
        The scripts will be made mainly based in Python and Pandas.
        
        First scripts will be coming soon :)
