        Esky  - keep frozen apps fresh
        ==============================
        
        Esky is an auto-update framework for frozen Python applications.  It provides
        a simple API through which apps can find, fetch and install updates, and a
        bootstrapping mechanism that keeps the app safe in the face of failed or
        partial updates.
        
        Esky is currently capable of freezing apps with py2exe, py2app and cxfreeze.
        Adding support for other freezer programs should be straightforward;
        patches will be gratefully accepted.
