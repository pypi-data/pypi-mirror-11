``print``, ``format``, and ``%`` evolved.

It's been *forty five years* since ``C`` introduced ``printf()`` and the basic
formatted printing of positional parameters. Isn't it time for an upgrade?
**Yes!** Indeed it is.

``say`` goes beyond Python's ``print``
statement/function, ``format`` function/method, and ``%`` string
interpolation operator with simpler, higher-level facilities. For example::

    from say import say

    x, nums, name = 12, list(range(4)), 'Fred'

    say("There are {x} things.")
    say("Nums has {len(nums)} items: {nums}")
    say("Name: {name!r}")

yields::

    There are 12 things.
    Nums has 4 items: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    Name: 'Fred'

At this level, ``say`` is basically a simpler, nicer recasting of::

    from __future__ import print_function

    print("There are {0} things.".format(x))
    print("Nums has {0} items: {1}".format(len(nums), nums))
    print("Name: {0!r}".format(name))

The more items being printed, and the more complicated the ``format``
invocation, the more valuable this simple inline specification becomes.
But ``say`` isn't just replacing positional templates with inline templates.
It also works in a variety of ways to up-level the output-generation task.
For example::

    say.title('Discovered')
    say("Name: {name:style=blue}", indent='+1')
    say("Age:  {age:style=blue}", indent='+1')


Prints a nicely formatted text block, with a proper title and indentation,
and just the variable information in blue.

``say`` provides:

* DRY, Pythonic templates that piggyback the
  Python's well-proven ``format()`` method, syntax, and underlying engine.
* A single output mechanism that works virtually
  the same in either Python 2 or Python 3 (i.e. seamless compatibility).
* A companion ``fmt()`` object for string formatting.
* Higher-order line formatting such as line numbering,
  indentation, and line-wrapping built in. You can get better output
  formatting with almost no additional code of your own.
* Convenient methods for common formatting items such as titles, horizontal
  separators, and vertical whitespace.
* Easy styled output, including ANSI colors and user-defined styles
  and text transforms.
* Easy output to one or more files, again with no additional code.
* Super-duper template/text aggregator objects for easily building,
  reading, and writing multi-line texts.
