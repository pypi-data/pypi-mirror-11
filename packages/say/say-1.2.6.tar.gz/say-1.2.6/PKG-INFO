        ``print``, ``format``, and ``%``, evolved.
        
        It's been *forty five years* since ``C`` introduced ``printf()`` and the basic
        formatted printing of positional parameters. Isn't it time for an upgrade?
        
        **Yes!** Indeed it is. ``say`` goes beyond Python's ``print``
        statement/function, ``format`` function/method, and ``%`` string
        interpolation operator with simpler, higher-level facilities. For example::
        
            from say import say
        
            x, nums, name = 12, list(range(4)), 'Fred'
        
            say("There are {x} things.")
            say("Nums has {len(nums)} items: {nums}")
            say("Name: {name!r}")
        
        yields::
        
            There are 12 things.
            Nums has 4 items: [0, 1, 2, 3]
            Name: 'Fred'
        
        At this level, ``say`` is basically a simpler, nicer recasting of::
        
            from __future__ import print_function
        
            print("There are {0} things.".format(x))
            print("Nums has {0} items: {1}".format(len(nums), nums))
            print("Name: {0!r}".format(name))
        
        The more items being printed, and the more complicated the ``format``
        invocation, the more valuable this simple inline specification becomes.
        But ``say`` isn't just replacing positional templates with inline templates.
        It also works in a variety of ways to up-level the output-generation task.
        For example::
        
            say.title('Discovered')
            say("Name: {name:style=blue}", indent='+1')
            say("Age:  {age:style=blue}", indent='+1')
        
        Prints a nicely formatted text block, with a proper title and indentation,
        and just the variable information in blue.
        
        ``say`` provides:
        
          * DRY, Pythonic templates that piggyback the
            Python's well-proven ``format()`` method, syntax, and underlying engine.
          * A single output mechanism that works virtually
            the same in either Python 2 or Python 3 (i.e. seamless compatibility).
          * A companion ``fmt()`` object for string formatting.
          * Higher-order line formatting such as line numbering,
            indentation, and line-wrapping built in. You can get better output
            formatting with almost no additional code of your own.
          * Convenient methods for common formatting items such as titles, horizontal
            separators, and vertical whitespace.
          * Easy styled output, including ANSI colors and user-defined styles
            and text transforms.
          * Easy output to one or more files, again with no additional code.
          * Super-duper template/text aggregator objects for easily building,
            reading, and writing multi-line texts.
