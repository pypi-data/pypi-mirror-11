CHANGES
=======

Version 1.3.3 (August 16, 2015)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Added ``sep`` method for separators.

* Some code cleanups and a few additional tests.Ã¥

* Officially switched to YAML-format Change Log (``CHANGES.yml``)


Version 1.3.2 (August 12, 2015)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Code cleanups.


Version 1.3.1 (August 11, 2015)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Doc, config, and testing updates. Removed ``joiner`` module and
  tests. May import that funcationality from ``quoter`` module in
  future.

* Python 2.6 currently unsupported due to issues with underlying
  ``stuf`` module. Support may return, depending on compatibility
  upgrades for future ``stuf`` releases.


Version 1.3 (July 22, 2015)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Added ``Template`` class. A deferred-rendering version of ``Text``


Version 1.2.6 (July 22, 2015)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Configuration, testing matrix, and doc tweaks.


Version 1.2.5 (December 29, 2014)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Fixed problem that was occuring with use of Unicode characters when
  rendered inside the Komodo IDE, which set the ``sys.stdout``
  encoding to ``US-ASCII`` not ``UTF-8``. In those cases, now inserts
  a codec-based writer object to do the encoding.


Version 1.2.4 (June 4, 2014)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Now testing for Python 3.3 and 3.4. One slight problem with them
  when encoding to base64 or similar bytes-oriented output that did
  not appear in earlier Python 3 builds. Examining.

* Added gittip link as an experiment.


Version 1.2.1 (October 16, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Fixed bug with quoting of style names/definitions.

* Tweaked documentation of style definitions.


Version 1.2.0 (September 30, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Added style definitions and convenient access to ANSI colors.


Version 1.1.0 (September 24, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Line numbering now an optional way to format output.

* Line wrapping is now much more precise. The ``wrap`` parameter now
  specifies the line length desired, including however many characters
  are consumed by prefix, suffix, and indentation.

* Vertical spacing is regularized and much better tested. The ``vsep``
  option, previously available only on a few methods, is now available
  everywhere. ``vsep=N`` gives N blank lines before and after the
  given output statement. ``vsep=(M,N)`` gives M blank lines before,
  and N blank lines after. A new ``Vertical`` class describes vertical
  spacing behind the scenes.

* ``Say`` no longer attempts to handle file encoding itself, but
  passes this responsibility off to file objects, such as those
  returned by ``io.open``. This is cleaner, though it does remove the
  whimsical possibility of automagical base64 and rot13 encodings. The
  ``encoding`` option is withdrawn as a result.

* You can now set the files you'd like to output to in the same way
  you'd set any other option (e.g. ``say.set(files=[...])`` or
  ``say.clone(files=[...])``). "Magic" parameter handling is enabled
  so that if any of the items listed are strings, then a file of that
  name is opened for writing. Beware, however, that if you manage the
  files option explicitly (e.g. ``say.options.files.append(...)``),
  you had better provide proper open files. No magical interpretation
  is done then. The previously-necessary ``say.setfiles()`` API
  remains, but is now deprecated.

* ``fmt()`` is now handled by ``Fmt``, a proper subclass of ``Say``,
  rather than just through instance settings.

* ``say()`` no longer returns the value it outputs. ``retvalue`` and
  ``encoded`` options have therefore been withdrawn.


Version 1.0.4 (September 16, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Had to back out part of the common ``__version__`` grabbing. Not
  compatible with Sphinx / readthedocs build process.


Version 1.0.3 (September 16, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Added ``FmtException`` class

* Tightened imports for namespace cleanliness.

* Doc tweaks.

* Added ``__version__`` metadata common to module, ``setup.py``, and
  docs.


Version 1.0.2 (September 14, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Added ``prefix`` and ``suffix`` options to ``say`` and ``fmt``,
  along with docs and tests.


Version 1.0.1 (September 13, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Moved main documentation to Sphinx format in ``./docs``, and hosted
  the long-form documentation on readthedocs.org. ``README.rst`` now
  an abridged version/teaser for the module.


Version 1.0 (September 16, 2013)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Cleaned up source for better PEP8 conformance

* Bumped version number to 1.0 as part of move to `semantic versioning
  <http://semver.org>`_, or at least enough of it so as to not screw
  up Python installation procedures (which don't seem to understand
  0.401 is a lesser version that 0.5, because 401 > 5).
