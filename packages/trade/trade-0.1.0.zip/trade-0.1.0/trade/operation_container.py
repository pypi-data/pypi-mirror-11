class OperationContainer:
    """A container for operations.

    An OperationContainer is used to group operations, like operations
    that occurred on the same date, and then perform tasks on them.

    The main task task that the OperationContainer can perform is to
    identify the resulting positions from a group of operations. The
    resulting positions are all operations separated as daytrades and
    common operations, with all common operations and daytrades with
    the same asset grouped into a single operation or a single
    daytrade.

    The resulting common operations and daytrades contains the
    OperationContiner commissions prorated by their volumes, and also
    any fees the OperationContainer TaxManager finds for them.

    This is achieved by calling this method:

        fetch_positions()

    Every time fetch_positions() is called the OperationContainer
    execute this tasks behind the scenes:

    - Separate the daytrades and the common operations of a group of
      operations that occurred on the same date by using the method:

        identify_daytrades_and_common_operations()

    - Prorate a group of commissions proportionally for all daytrades
      and common operations, if any, by using the method:

        prorate_commissions()

    - Find the appliable rates for the resulting positions by calling
      this method:

        find_rates_for_positions()

    Attributes:
        date: A string 'YYYY-mm-dd' representing the date of the
            operations on the container.
        operations: A list of Operation instances.
        commissions: A dict with discount names and values to be
            deducted from the operations.
        daytrades: a dict of Daytrade objects, indexed by the daytrade
            asset.
        common_operations: a dict of Operation objects, indexed by the
            operation asset.
        self.exercise_operations: a dict of Operation objects, indexed
            by the operation asset. The operations are operations
            created by option exercises.
        fetch_positions_tasks: a list of OperationContainer methods.
            The methods will be called in the order they are defined
            in this list when fetch_positions() is called.
