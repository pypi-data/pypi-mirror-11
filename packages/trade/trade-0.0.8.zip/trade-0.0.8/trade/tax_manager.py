class TaxManager:
    """The base TaxManager.

    A TaxManager object reads an operation and returns the
    correspondent percentual fees for that operation. Since fees
    (and also the way they are applied) may vary greatly from one
    context to another, this class just implements a dummy interface
    for the fee discovery process, always returning a empty dictionary
    of taxes.

    Every OperationContainer object has a reference to an instance
    of this TaxManager. If your app need to apply fees to your
    Operation objects, then you should extend this class and inform
    the new TaxManager to your OperationContainer by

        operation_container_object.tax_manger = your_tax_manager_object

    The OperationContainer always access his TaxManager object when
    fetch_positions() is called. Behind the scenes the container
    calls this methods from the TaxManager object:

        tax_manager.get_fees_for_operation(operation)
        tax_manager.get_fees_for_daytrade(operation)

    for every operation and daytrade present on the container.
