What is it?
-----------
trade is a Python module that provides basic notions of assets, purchases,
sales, daytrades, cost deduction, rates, options, option exercises
and asset accumulation.

With the trade module you can:
* Identify daytrades in a group of operations
* Prorate commissions and other costs by groups of operations  
* Apply rates on operations
* Calculate the average price of an asset after a series of operations
* Calculate profits or losses relative to an asset, considering all rates and costs involved on its operations


How do I install the trade module?
----------------------------------
The trade module can be installed with pip:

> pip install trade

To check if everything went OK, open the Python console and import the module:

```python
import trade
asset = trade.Asset(name='some asset')
print(asset.name)
#>> some asset
```


How can I use it?
-----------------
A basic example of the trade module in action:

```python
import trade

# create the asset that we are going to trade
asset = trade.Asset(name='Google Inc', symbol='GOOGL')

# create the accumulator to accumulate trades with the asset
accumulator = trade.Accumulator(asset)


print(accumulator.asset.name)
#>> Google Inc

print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 0

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 0

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 0}


# create a trade operation buying the asset
purchase = trade.Operation(
                asset=asset,
                quantity=10,
                price=650.73,
                date='2015-09-23'
            )

# accumulate the trade
accumulator.accumulate_operation(purchase)


print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 10

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 650.73

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 0}


# create a new trade operation selling the asset
sale = trade.Operation(
            asset=asset,
            quantity=-5,
            price=656.77,
            date='2015-09-24'
        )

# accumulate the new trade
accumulator.accumulate_operation(sale)


print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 5

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 650.73

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'daytrades': 0, 'trades': 30.199999999999818}
```

Operation objects may include rates and commissions that are considered by the
accumulator when it calculates results and average prices.

The Accumulator can also log the accumulated operations and their results.

Check the [documentation](http://trade.readthedocs.org) for all the available features.


What about compatibility?
-------------------------
The trade module is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.
