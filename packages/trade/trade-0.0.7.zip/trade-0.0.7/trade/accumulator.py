            status change of the accumulator.
        quantity: The asset's accumulated quantity.
        price: The asset's average price for the quantity accumulated.
        results: A dict with the total results from the operations
            accumulated.
        logging: A boolean indicating if the accumulator should log
            the calls to the accumulate() method.
        log: A dict with all the operations performed with the asset,
            provided that self.logging is True.

    if created with logging=True the accumulator will log the every
    operation it accumulates.
