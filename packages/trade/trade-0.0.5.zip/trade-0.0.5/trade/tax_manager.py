class TaxManager:
    """A base TaxManager.

    A TaxManager object reads an operation and returns the
    correspondent percentual taxes for that operation. Since taxes
    (and also the way they are applyed) may vary greatly from one
    context to another, this class only implements a dumb interface
    for the tax discovery process, always returning a empty dict of
    taxes.

    Every OperationContainer object have a reference to an instance
    of this TaxManager. If your app need to apply taxes to your
    Operation objects, extend this class and inform the new TaxManager
    to your OperationContainer by

        operation_container_object.tax_manger = your_tax_manager_object

    The OperationContainer will always access the TaxManager when
    fetch_positions() is called. Behind the scenes the container will
    call this methods from the TaxManager object:

        tax_manager.get_taxes_for_operation(operation)
        tax_manager.get_taxes_for_daytrade(operation)

    for every operation and daytrade present on the container
    position dict. These taxes will then be considered when calculating
    the results and average price resulting from the operations.
