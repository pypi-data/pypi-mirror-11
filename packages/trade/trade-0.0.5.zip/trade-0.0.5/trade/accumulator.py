        price: The asset's average price for the quantity accumulated.
        results: A dict with the total results from the operations
            accumulated.
        logging: A boolean indicating if the accumulator should log
            the calls to the accumulate() method.
        log: A dict with all the operations performed with the asset,
            provided that self.logging is True.

    if created with log_operations=True the accumulator will log the
    data and the results of every operation it accumulate.

    Results are calculated by the accumulator according to the value
    of the operations informed and the current status of the
    accumulator (the current quantity and average price of the asset).
