What is it?
-----------
trade is a Python module with functions and classes for the development
of investment applications in Python. It provides basic notions of assets,
operations, daytrades, cost deduction, asset accumulation and so on.

You may use the trade module as a framework to create applications that
implement specific rules of stock markets around the world or use it "as is"
in any  application that requires the notion of buying things, selling things
and controlling how much you spent to buy and how much you profited from the
trades.


How do I install the trade module?
------------------------------
The trade module can be installated via pip:

> pip install trade

To check if everything went OK, open the Python console and import the module:

```python
import trade
asset = trade.Asset('some asset')
print(asset.name)
#>> some asset
```


How can I use it?
-----------------
A basic example of the trade module in action:

```python
import trade

# create the asset that we are going to trade
asset = trade.Asset('Some asset')

# create the accumulator to accumulate trades with the asset
accumulator = trade.Accumulator(asset)


print(accumulator.asset.name)
#>> Some asset

print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 0

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 0

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 0}


# create a trade operation buying the asset
purchase = trade.Operation(asset=asset, quantity=10, price=2, date='2015-09-22')

# accumulate the trade
accumulator.accumulate_operation(purchase)


print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 10

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 2.0

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 0}


# create a new trade operation selling the asset
sale = trade.Operation(asset=asset, quantity=-5, price=3, date='2015-09-23')

# accumulate the new trade
accumulator.accumulate_operation(sale)


print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 5

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 2.0

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 5.0}
```

You may also use only the Accumulator and ignore everything else:
```python
import trade

# create the asset that we are going to trade
asset = 'Some asset'

# create the accumulator to accumulate trades with the asset
accumulator = trade.Accumulator(asset)


print(accumulator.asset)
#>> Some asset

print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 0

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 0

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 0}


# accumulate trade data
accumulator.accumulate(quantity=10, price=2, date='2015-09-22')


print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 10

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 2.0

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 0}


# accumulate more trade
accumulator.accumulate(quantity=-5, price=3, date='2015-09-23')


print(accumulator.quantity)
#>> 5

print(accumulator.price)
#>> 2.0

print(accumulator.results)
#>> {'trades': 5.0}

```

Operation objects may include taxes and comissions that are considered by the
accumulator when calculating results and portfolio prices.

The Accumulator can also log the accumulated operations and their results.

There are more features, like rating and applying discounts automatically
to a group of operations, separating daytrades from common trades in a group of
operations, calculating the resulting position from a group of operations and so
on. Check the documentation and the examples for more information on how to
use the trade module.


What about compatibility?
-------------------------
The trade module is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.
