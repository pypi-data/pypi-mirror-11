class OperationContainer:
    """A container for operations.

    An OperationContainer is used to group operations, like operations
    that occurred on the same date, and then perform tasks on them.

    The main task task that the OperationContainer can perform is to
    identify the resulting positions from a group of operations. The
    resulting positions are all operations separated as daytrades and
    common operations, with all common operations and daytrades with
    the same asset grouped into a single operation or a single
    daytrade.

    The resulting common operations and daytrades contains the
    OperationContiner commissions prorated by their volumes, and also
    any rates the OperationContainer TaxManager finds for them.

    This is achieved by calling this method:

        fetch_positions()

    Every time fetch_positions() is called the OperationContainer
    execute this tasks behind the scenes:

    - Execute all tasks defined in self.fetch_positions_tasks.

    - Create positions in self.positions for all operations in
      self.operations.

    - Prorate the commissions, if any, proportionally for all positions
      by calling:

        prorate_commissions()

    - Find the rates, if any, for the resulting positions by calling:

        find_rates_for_positions()

    Attributes:
        date: A string 'YYYY-mm-dd' representing the date of the
            operations on the container.
        operations: A list of Operation instances.
        commissions: A dict with discount names and values to be
            deducted from the operations.
        positions: a dict of positions with this format:
            self.positions = {
                'position type': {
                    Asset: Operation,
                    ...
                },
                ...
            }
        fetch_positions_tasks: a list of functions. The functions will
            be called in the order they are defined in this list when
            fetch_positions() is called. Every listed function must
            receive a OperationContainer object. They are like this:

                def some_task(container):
                    #do some stuff with container...

            The functions may change the Operation objects in
            self.operations, if needed (like when you separate
            daytrades from other operations).
