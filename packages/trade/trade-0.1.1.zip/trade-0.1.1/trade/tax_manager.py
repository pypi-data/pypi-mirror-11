class TaxManager:
    """The base TaxManager.

    A TaxManager object reads an operation and returns the
    correspondent rates for that operation. Since rates (and also the
    way they are applied) may vary greatly from one context to another,
    this class just implements a dummy interface for the rate discovery
    process, always returning a empty dictionary of rates.

    Every OperationContainer object has a reference to this class.
    If your app need to apply fees to your Operation objects, then you
    should extend this class and inform the new TaxManager to your
    OperationContainer:

        operation_container_object.tax_manger = your_tax_manager_object

    The OperationContainer always access his TaxManager class when
    fetch_positions() is called. Behind the scenes the container
    calls this method from the TaxManager class:

        tax_manager.get_rates_for_operation(operation, operation_type)

    After identifying the positions for every position present on the container.
