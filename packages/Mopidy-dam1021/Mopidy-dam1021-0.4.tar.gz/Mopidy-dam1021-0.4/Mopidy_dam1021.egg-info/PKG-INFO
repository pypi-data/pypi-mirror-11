        **************
        
        `Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension for controlling volume using a `dam1021 DAC <http://soekris.dk/dam1021.html>`_ device. 
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running::
        
            sudo pip install Mopidy-dam1021
        
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The Mopidy-dam1021 extension is enabled by default. To disable it, add the following to ``mopidy.conf``::
        
            [dam1021]
            enabled = false
        
        The dam1021 DAC must be connected to a serial port of the machine running Mopidy. This does not meant the both devices must be physically connected together using a serial cable. Although this is the most obvious configuration. Another option is to use network tunneling using `socat <http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/>`_ or any other similar utility. Bear in mind system user on behalf of which Mopidy operates on must have proper access rights to a serial port. E.g. the following needs to be done on Raspian::
        
          # usermod -G dialout mopidy
        
        To use the DAC to control volume, set the ``audio/mixer`` config
        value in ``mopidy.conf`` to ``dam1021mixer``. You probably should add some
        properties to the ``dam1021`` config section too.
        
        The following properties are available:
        
        - ``serial``: The serial device to use, defaults to ``/dev/ttyAMA0``. This must be set correctly for the mixer to work.
        
        - ``volume_inf``: The DAC volume control utilizes idea of signal attenuation in a digital domain, where ``0`` means unaltered signal, ``-80`` - maximal attenuation, ``10`` - maximal gain. This property defines lower bound of volume levels available to the mixer. Usually you should operate between ``-80`` and ``0``. Using narrower margins translates to a finer volume control. Defaults to ``-80``. 
        
        - ``volume_sup``: The upper bound of volume levels available to the mixer. See ``volume_inf``. Defaults to ``0``. 
        
        - ``timeout``: Timeout value for any given operation on serial line, used by a lower level library. Expressed in milliseconds. Defaults to 2000.
        
        
        Configuration example with all default values, suitable for Raspberry Pi users::
        
            [audio]
            mixer = dam1021mixer
        
        Configuration example, if the DAC is available elsewhere::
        
            [audio]
            mixer = dam1021mixer
        
            [dam1021]
            port = /dev/ttyUSB0
        
        Configuration example with a customized volume level range::
        
            [audio]
            mixer = dam1021mixer
        
            [dam1021]
            port = /dev/ttyUSB0
            volume_inf = -45
            volume_sup = -5
