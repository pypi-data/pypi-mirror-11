=========================================
 AVspoof Database Interface for Bob
=========================================

AVspoof_ is intended to provide stable, non-biased spoofing attacks in order for researchers to test both their ASV systems and anti-spoofing algorithms. The attacks are created based on newly acquired audio recordings. The data acquisition process lasted approximately two months with 44 persons, each participating in several sessions configured in different environmental conditions and setups. After the collection of the data, the attacks, more precisely, replay, voice conversion and speech synthesis attacks were generated.
