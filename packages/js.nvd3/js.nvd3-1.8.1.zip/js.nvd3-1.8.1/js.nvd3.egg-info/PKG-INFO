        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `NVD3`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`NVD3`: http://nvd3.org
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.nvd3``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``nvd3`` from ``js.nvd3`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.nvd3 import nvd3
          >>> nvd3.need()
