Description: PIP Installable version of Vowpal Wabbit.
        
        You need to have boost (libboost-program-options-dev and libboost-python-dev) and python
        development packages installed on your system for it to build correctly. See the Vowpal Wabbit
        side for more information about building VW.
        
        Since the pyvw wrapper bundled with Vowpal Wabbit links statically to libvw.a this package will
        always build it's own library and (currently) cannot use the system installed libvw.so provided
        by distribution packages.
