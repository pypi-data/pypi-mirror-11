# Overview

`monasca-events-api` is a RESTful API server that is designed with a layered architecture [layered architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayered_architecture).

## Keystone Configuration

For secure operation of the Monasca Events API, the API must be configured to use Keystone in the configuration file under the middleware section. Monasca only works with a Keystone v3 server. The important parts of the configuration are explained below:

* serverVIP - This is the hostname or IP Address of the Keystone server
* serverPort - The port for the Keystone server
* useHttps - Whether to use https when making requests of the Keystone API
* truststore - If useHttps is true and the Keystone server is not using a certificate signed by a public CA recognized by Java, the CA certificate can be placed in a truststore so the Monasca API will trust it, otherwise it will reject the https connection. This must be a JKS truststore
* truststorePassword - The password for the above truststore
* connSSLClientAuth - If the Keystone server requires the SSL client used by the Monasca server to have a specific client certificate, this should be true, false otherwise
* keystore - The keystore holding the SSL Client certificate if connSSLClientAuth is true
* keystorePassword - The password for the keystore
* defaultAuthorizedRoles - An array of roles that authorize a user to access the complete Monasca API. User must have at least one of these roles. See below
* agentAuthorizedRoles - An array of roles that authorize only the posting of metrics.  See Keystone Roles below
* adminAuthMethod - "password" if the Monasca API should adminUser and adminPassword to login to the Keystone server to check the user's token, "token" if the Monasca API should use adminToken
* adminUser - Admin user name
* adminPassword - Admin user password
* adminProjectId - Specify the project ID the api should use to request an admin token. Defaults to the admin user's default project. The adminProjectId option takes precedence over adminProjectName.
* adminProjectName - Specify the project name the api should use to request an admin token. Defaults to the admin user's default project. The adminProjectId option takes precedence over adminProjectName.
* adminToken - A valid admin user token if adminAuthMethod is token
* timeToCacheToken - How long the Monasca API should cache the user's token before checking it again

### Installation

To install the events api, git clone the source and run the
following commands:

    sudo python setup.py install

If it installs successfully, you will need to make changes to the following
two files to reflect your system settings, especially where kafka server is
located:

    /etc/monasca/events_api.ini
    /etc/monasca/events_api.conf

Once the configurations are modified to match your environment, you can start
up the server by following the following instructions.

To start the server, run the following command:

    Running the server in foreground mode
    gunicorn -k eventlet --worker-connections=2000 --backlog=1000 --paste /etc/monasca/events_api.ini

    Running the server as daemons
    gunicorn -k eventlet --worker-connections=2000 --backlog=1000
             --paste /etc/monasca/events_api.ini -D

To check if the code follows python coding style, run the following command
from the root directory of this project

    tox -e pep8

To run all the unit test cases, run the following command from the root
directory of this project

    tox -e py27   (or -e py26, -e py33)
