Documentation

This library implements efficient algorithms in linear algebra
for solving various inference and estimation problems
in networks with observed heteorphily between classes of nodes (Heterophily: "Opposites attract" vs. Homophily: "Birds of a feather flock together").
The technical framework is that of undirected graphical models (Markov Random Fields or Markov Networks).
The key idea is that after applying certain linearization assumptions (that change the semantics) the resulting formulations
allow several orders of magnitude speed-up in calculation.

The methods are described in detail in the following papers:

1. `Linearized and Single-Pass Belief Propagation <http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8.html>`__. `Wolfgang Gatterbauer <http://gatterbauer.co>`__, `Stephan GÃ¼nnemann <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sguennem/>`__, `Danai Koutra <http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/>`__, `Christos Faloutsos <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/>`__. PVLDB 8(5): 581-592 (2015). [`Paper (PDF) <http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p581-gatterbauer.pdf>`__], [`Full version (PDF) <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7288>`__]

2.  `Semi-Supervised Learning with Heterophily <http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3100>`__. `Wolfgang Gatterbauer <http://gatterbauer.co>`__ [`Working paper (PDF) <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3100>`__]


Usage & Documentation
---------------------

The package consists of:

1. A directory ``sslh`` that contains files with the main methods

2. A directory ``test`` that contains the test files, each of which makes use of methods from the corresonding file in the ``sslh`` directory.

Thus ideally take a look in the ``test`` directory, run some files and look through the annotations in the files.


Installation
------------

The latest version of SSLH can be installed from the master branch using pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install sslh

or

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/wolfandthegang/sslh/

Another option is to clone the repository and install SSLH using ``python setup.py install`` or ``python setup.py develop``.



Dependencies
------------

SSLH is tested on Python 2.7 and depends on NumPy, SciPy, Sklearn, and PyAMG (see setup.py for version information).
