        ======
        Download, translate subtitles for NRK TV programs.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        - Python 3.4+
        - Beautiful Soup 4
        - Requests
        
        Usage
        -----
        To download subtitles for a programs, provide it's URL as the first argument::
        
         $ url='https://tv.nrk.no/serie/side-om-side/MUHH48000415/sesong-3/episode-4'
         $ ./nrksub.py $url
        
        Help
        ****
        All command line options and arguments, and their purposes can be queried using
        the help switch::
        
         $ ./nrksub.py --help
        
        File
        ****
        By default, nrksub will print the subtitles out to STDOUT. To write to a file,
        provide a file name as the second argument::
        
         $ ./nrksub.py $url nytt-paa-nytt-26-12-2014.srt
        
        Translate
        *********
        nrksub can translate the Norwegian subtitles provided by NRK automatically using
        Google Translate. The translations are by no means perfect, but they are better
        than nothing. By default, the subtitles are translated to English, but you can
        use any language supported by Google Translate::
        
         $ ./nrksub.py --lang es $url
         Spanish output
         $ ./nrksub.py --lang de $url
         German output
        
        If you want the original Norwegian subtitles, set the language to ``no``
        (for Norwegian). This will skip the translation process::
        
         $ ./nrksub.py --lang no $url
        
        Format
        ******
        By default, nrksub will output SRT format subtitles. nrksub can also output
        TTML format subtitles, but this is mostly for debugging purposes and of little
        use, as rarely any video player supports them::
        
         $ ./nrksub.py --format ttml $url
        
        More formats maybe added in the future, if I have the time.
