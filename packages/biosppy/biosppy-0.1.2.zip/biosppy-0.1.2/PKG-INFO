Description: BioSPPy - Biosignal Processing in Python
        ========================================
        
        A toolbox for biosignal processing written in Python.
        
        The toolbox bundles together various signal processing and pattern
        recognition methods geared towards the analysis of biosignals.
        
        Highlights:
        
        -  Support for various biosignals: BVP, ECG, EDA, EEG, EMG, Respiration;
        -  Signal analysis primitives: filtering, frequency analysis
        -  Clustering
        -  Biometrics (to do)
