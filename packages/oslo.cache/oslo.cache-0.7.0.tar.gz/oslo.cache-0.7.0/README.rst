`oslo.cache` aims to provide a generic caching mechanism for OpenStack projects
by wrapping the `dogpile.cache
<http://dogpilecache.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ library. The dogpile.cache
library provides support memoization, key value storage and interfaces to common
caching backends such as `Memcached <http://www.memcached.org/>`_.
