        Download and install
        ====================
        
        Install Mailcat with ``pip``::
        
            pip install mailcat
        
        
        To use Mailcat with ``less``, add this to ``~/.lessfilter``::
        
            
            #!/bin/sh
        
            case "$1" in
                *.eml|*.mbx|*.mbox)
                    mailcat --color=always "$1"
                    exit 0
                    ;;
            esac
        
            exit 1
        
        
        and make ``~/.lessfilter`` executable::
        
            chmod +x ~/.lessfilter
