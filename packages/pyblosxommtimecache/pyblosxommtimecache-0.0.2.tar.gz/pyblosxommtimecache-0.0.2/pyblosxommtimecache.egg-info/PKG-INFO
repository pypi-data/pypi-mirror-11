Description: # pyblosxommtimecache
        
        pyblosxommtimecache is a [PyBlosxom](https://pyblosxom.github.io/) filestat
        plugin that caches your entries mtimes in a `.mtimes.yaml` file in your
        datadir.
        
        The first time it sees each new blog entry, pyblosxommtimecache will add the
        entry's mtime to the `.mtimes.yaml` file. It then makes PyBlosxom use these
        cached mtimes as the mtimes of your blog entries, instead of using the mtimes
        of the files themselves.
        
        This means that if you edit an entry its mtime won't change and it won't jump
        to the top of your blog. It also means that PyBlosxom isn't doing costly
        `os.stat()` calls on every entry file every time it renders a page.
        
        pyblosxommtimecache will automatically create the `.mtimes.yaml` file for you
        the first time it runs.
        
        The `.mtimes.yaml` file is a simple [YAML](http://yaml.org/)-formatted text
        file. If you want to change the mtime of an entry you can just edit this file
        by hand. If an entry is deleted from the file, or if the entire file is
        deleted, it'll just be regenerated using the current mtimes of your entry
        files.
