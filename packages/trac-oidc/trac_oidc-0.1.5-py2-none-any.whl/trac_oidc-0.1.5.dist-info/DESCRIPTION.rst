===================================
Trac-oidc — OpenID Connect for Trac
===================================

|version| |trac versions| |build status|

***********
Description
***********

A plugin to support authentication to trac_ using the `OpenID
Connect`_ protocol.  Currently this probably only works with
Google_\’s *OpenID Provider*.

This plugin was written as a partial replacement for the
TracAuthOpenId_, since Google has (as of mid-June, 2015) `discontinued
support`_ for authentication using *OpenID 2.0*.
Google’s extension_ for mapping *OpenID 2.0* identifiers to *OpenID
Connect* identifiers is used, so sites which previously used
``TracAuthOpenId`` for authentication against Google *should* be able
to switch to using ``trac-oidc`` without losing track of user’s
settings and permissions.

This plugin is tested with trac versions 0.11, 0.12, 1.0, and 1.1.

The distribution may be downloaded from PyPI_.
Development takes place at github_.

*****
Usage
*****

Obtain OAuth 2.0 Credentials
============================

You must obtain *OAuth 2.0 credentials* from Google before you can
use this plugin.

1. Go to the `Google Developers Console`_.

.. _google developers console: https://console.developers.google.com/

2. Select a project, or create a new one.

3. In the sidebar on the left, expand **APIs & auth**.
   Next, click **APIs**.
   Select the **Enabled APIs** link in the API section to see a list
   of all your enabled APIs.

4. *Optional, but recommended*:
   Make sure that the **Google+ API** is on the list of enabled APIs.
   If you have not enabled it, select the API from the list of APIs,
   then select the Enable API button for the API.  (The Google+ API is
   used to retrieve the user’s real name on initial sign in.)

5. In the sidebar on the left, select **Credentials**.

6. If you haven't done so already, create your project's
   OAuth 2.0 credentials by clicking **Create new Client ID**,
   and providing the information needed to create the credentials.

7. The *redirect URI* used by this plugin is the base url for your trac
   followed by ``/trac_oidc/redirect``. I.e. if the top of your trac
   is at ``http://example.org/mytrac``, then the *redirect URI* will
   be ``http://example.org/mytrac/trac_oidc/redirect``.  If your trac
   is available under multiple hostnames, or under both ``http:``
   and ``https:`` schemes, then you may need to configure multiple
   *redirect URI*\s.

8. When all looks copacetic, click the **Download JSON** button (on
   the **Credentials** page) to download a JSON file containing the
   required client secrets.  Save this file to somewhere where trac
   can read it.  By default, the plugin looks for this file under the
   name ``client_secret.json`` in the ``conf`` subdirectory of the
   trac environment, however this can be configured.  (Since the file
   contains sensitive information, consider setting the file
   permissions so that not just anybody can read it.)


Install the Plugin
==================

The plugin is available from PyPI_, so it may be installed,
e.g., using pip_::

      pip install trac-oidc

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

Configuration
=============

In your ``trac.ini``::

  [components]

  # You must enable the trac_oidc plugin
  trac_oidc.* = enabled

  # Optional: You probably want to disable the stock login module
  trac.web.auth.loginmodule = disabled

  [trac_oidc]

  # Optional: Specify the path to the client secrets JSON file.
  # The default is ``client_secret.json``.  Relative paths are
  # interpreted relative to the ``conf`` subdirectory of the trac
  # environment (i.e. alongside ``trac.ini``.)
  client_secret_file = /path/to/client_secret.json

  [openid]

  # Optional: This only matters if you would like to migrate
  # users created by the TracAuthOpenId_ plugin to this one.
  # In that case, the OpenID realm must be set to the same value
  # that was used by TracAuthOpenId (where it is called the *trust root*)
  # for the identity URLs to be comparable.
  #
  # If this is set, then the OpenID realm will include just the hostname,
  # otherwise the realm will include the full base path of the trac.
  # E.g. if you trac is is ``http://example.org:8080/mytrac``, then the realm
  # will be ``http://example.org:8080/`` if ``absolute_trust_root`` is set
  # and ``http://example.org:8080/mytrac`` if ``absolute_trust_root`` is
  # not set.
  #
  # The default is ``true``.
  #
  absolute_trust_root = false

*****************************
Migration from TracAuthOpenId
*****************************

If you used **only** Google as the authentication provider with
TracAuthOpenId_, then you should be able to disable
``TracAuthOpenId``, configure and enable ``trac-oidc``, and things
*should* just work — users should keep their sessions (i.e. they will
retain their settings and permissions.)

.. note::

   Make sure not to change the setting of ``absolute_trust_root`` from
   whatever you were using with ``TracAuthOpenId``.

If you were using multiple authentication providers with ``TracAuthOpenId``,
it should be possible to run both ``TracAuthOpenId`` (with Google disabled),
and ``trac-oidc`` together.  I have not tried this, however, and some tuning
will probably be required.

*****
To Do
*****

Possible improvements.

Generalize to work with more providers
======================================

Though, currently, only authentication via Google’s OP is supported,
it should be straightforward to generalize the plugin to work with other
*OpenID Connect* providers, and other authentication services based on
*OAuth 2.0* (e.g. Twitter, Facebook.)


Integrate with AccountManagerPlugin
===================================

I’m not sure exactly what’s involved, but it would be nice if the
AccountManagerPlugin_ could be used to administer associations between
OIDC subject identifiers and authenticated sessions, etc.

*******
History
*******

0.1.5 (2015-07-16)
==================

- If the stock ``trac.web.auth.LoginModule`` is disabled, then handle
  requests for ``/login`` too (because no one else is going to.)

0.1.4 (2015-06-24)
==================

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Tests now run under trac 1.1.5

0.1.3 (2015-06-23)
==================

Behavioral Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In the "logged in as %(user)s" message (in the *metanav* menu),
  *user* is now always set to the *session id* (also referred to as the
  *authname*) of the logged-in user.  Previously the real name of the
  user was shown instead, when it was available.  This now matches the
  behavior of the stock ``LoginModule`` component.

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The *Logout* link should now work again.  It was broken for trac >= 1.0.2.

Large Refactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Lots of code cleanup, including splitting of logic into several
  components/classes, include:

  - ``AuthCookieManager``: for managing the trac authentication cookie

  - ``UserDatabase``: for mapping between *OpenID identities* and trac
    *authname*\s.

  - ``SessionHelper``: for searching and managing authenticated sessions

  - ``Authenticator``: for handling the *OpenID Connect* flow

0.1.2 (2015-06-20)
==================

Features
~~~~~~~~

- The plugin should now work with trac 0.11.

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- [trac > 1.0.2] Fixed *Logout* link so that it works under trac >
  1.0.2.  Recent tracs use a logout form rather than a link (for CSRF
  protection.)

Testing
~~~~~~~

- Added a functional test.  Run tests with trac version 0.11, 0.12 and
  latest (1.0).

Refactor
~~~~~~~~

- Renamed ``trac_oidc.plugin`` module to ``trac_oidc.trac_oidc``.
  Trac’s default log format string includes ``"[%(module)s]"`` —
  ``[trac_oidc]`` is much more informative than ``[plugin]``.


0.1.1 (2015-06-18)
==================

Initial release.  There is no 0.1 (I botched the upload to PyPI).
