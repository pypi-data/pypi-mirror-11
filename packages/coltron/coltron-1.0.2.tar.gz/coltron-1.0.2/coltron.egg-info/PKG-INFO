        =======
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Coltron is an application designed to build transcriptional regulatory networks.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installation of Coltron has only been vetted on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. If you encounter \
        any errors in the installation process, please contact drpolaskijr@gmail.com for additional help.
        
        **Confirm PIP Installation**::
        
              pip --version                                                                                            
              pip 1.5.6 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip-1.5.6-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
        
        If the pip --version command generates a command not found error, you will have to download PIP. Instructions for the installation can be found at the following `location
        <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_. 
        
        Run the following command to start the module download::
        
              $ sudo pip install coltron
        
        This command should produce output that looks like this::
        
              $ sudo pip install coltron

        Once the PIP installation is complete, the data files that Coltron uses to operate must be downloaded.
        
        **Data Download**
        
        Coltron provides a command for downloading its required files. The command can be executed as follows::
              
              $ sudo coltron-get-data
        
        The required data is downloaded from the web and stored in Coltron's data repository. This process can be time consuming.
        
        Usage
        -----
        The following command is used to run the main Coltron executable::
        
        $ coltron [options] -e [ENHANCER_FILE] -b [BAM_FILE] -g [GENOME] -o [OUTPUTFOLDER] -n [NAME]
