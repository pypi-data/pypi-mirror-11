        ===========
        Compound Pi
        ===========
        
        This project provides a means for controlling multiple `cameras`_ attached to
        `Raspberry Pis`_ all of which are attached to the same subnet. Broadcast UDP
        packets are utilized to permit near-simultaneous triggering of all attached
        cameras.
