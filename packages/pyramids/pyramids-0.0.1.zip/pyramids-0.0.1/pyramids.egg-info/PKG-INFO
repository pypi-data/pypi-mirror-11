        Pyramids gets its name from the way it constructs parse trees, working
        upwards from the leaves towards the root, building up layers of
        progressively smaller size but greater scope. It is a rule-based natural
        language parser, tailored specifically for English, which builds
        multiple competing parses for a sentence from the bottom up using
        principles of dynamic programming. The parses are then scored for
        quality and presented in order of descending rank. The parser is also
        capable of accepting feedback as to which parses are or are not
        acceptable, adaptively adjusting its scoring measures to improve future
        parse quality and ranking. Parses are returned as trees but can also be
        used to generate graphs representing the semantic relationships between
        words. The syntactic rules of the parser can also be run in reverse to
        generate sentences from semantic graphs resembling those it produces.
