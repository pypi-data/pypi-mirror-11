        ================
        
        This program provides just enough glue to use the excellent `CodeMirror
        <http://codemirror.net/>`_ as an editor for local files.
        
        Do the following::
        
            pip install eow
        
            eow --keymap=vim --password=mypassword file-to-edit.txt
        
        Instead of specifying a file on the command line, you may also go to
        `http://localhost:9113/e/file-to-edit.txt <http://localhost:9113/e/file-to-edit.txt>`_.
        
        For what it's worth, the author uses this to edit LaTeX files on a Linux system
        from within a Windows virtual machine with the help of Windows-only speech
        recognition software... :)
