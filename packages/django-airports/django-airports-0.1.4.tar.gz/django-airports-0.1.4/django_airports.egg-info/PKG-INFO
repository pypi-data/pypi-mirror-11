        ----
        
        ### Requirements
        
        You must have *django-cities* installed and configured, see the [django-cities documentation](https://github.com/coderholic/django-cities) for details and setup instructions.
        
        ### Setup
        
        Either clone this repository into your project, or install with ```pip install django-airports```
        
        You'll need to add ```airports``` to ```INSTALLED_APPS``` in your project's ```settings.py``` file:
        
        ```python
        import django
        
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'airports',
        )
        
        if django.VERSION < (1, 7):
            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'south',
            )
        ```
        
        Then run ```./manage.py syncdb``` to create the required database tables, and ```./manage.py airports``` to import all of the airports data. **NOTE:** This can take some time.
        
        Please see ``example`` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package. This also serves as a good example.
        
        You need Django 1.4 or above to run that. It might run on older versions but that is not tested.
        
        ### Notes
        
        The ```airports``` manage command has options, see ```airports --help``` output.  Verbosity is controlled through LOGGING.
