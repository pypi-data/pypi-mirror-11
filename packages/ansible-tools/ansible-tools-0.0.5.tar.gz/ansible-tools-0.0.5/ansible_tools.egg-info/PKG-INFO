Description: ansible-tools
        =============
        
        |PyPI| |MIT License|
        
        This is a set of wrappers around the ``ansible``, ``ansible-playbook``
        and ``ansible-vault`` commands which integrate with the system keyring
        to retrieve the vault password.
        
        It should work on both Linux and OS X.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you are on OS X and have Homebrew's Python:
        
        ::
        
            pip install ansible-tools
        
        Otherwise:
        
        ::
        
            pip install --user ansible-tools
        
        Then make sure to add the local pip's ``bin`` directory to the
        ``$PATH``. Since it is different on each platform, please refer to its
        documentation.
        
        Otherwise, if you're feeling a badass and want to ``sudo`` your way out,
        then run:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install ansible-tools
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Go to the same directory that contains your playbooks and then run:
        
        ::
        
            ansible-vault-helper --update
        
        You will be prompted for a vault name (which can be anything) and the
        unlock password. The former is stored in ``ansible.cfg`` alongside your
        playbooks, the latter is securely stored in your keyring.
        
        At this point you can run Ansible as usual but precede the command with
        ``vaultify``. That is, to start a playbook run:
        
        ::
        
            vaultify ansible-playbook site.yml
        
        We also ship a tool to easily apply a playbook on the current system
        called ``ansible-local`` which is composable with ``vaultify``.
        
        Aliases
        =======
        
        Here's a list of handy shell aliases to make your life easier. They were
        tested on fish but should work also on Bash and Zsh:
        
        ::
        
            alias v="vault"
            alias ansible="vaultify ansible"
            alias ansible-playbook="vaultify ansible-playbook"
