Fake List Detection
###################

The default behavior
in PyDocX
is to convert
"faked" lists
into "real" lists.

A "faked" list
is a sequence of paragraphs
in which the numbering
has been explicitly
typed.
Additionally,
the spacing
across levels
is manually set
either using
tab characters,
or indentation.
For example: ::

    1. Apple
    2. Banana
       a. Chiquita
       b. Dole
    3. Carrot

Conversely,
a "real" list
is a sequence of paragraphs
in which the numbering,
and spacing,
is automatic:

#. Apple
#. Banana

   a. Chiquita
   #. Dole
#. Carrot

Extend the exporter
to override
the ``numbering_span_builder_class``
class variable
as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from pydocx.export.numbering_span import BaseNumberingSpanBuilder

    class CustomExporter(PyDocXHTMLExporter):
        numbering_span_builder_class = BaseNumberingSpanBuilder
