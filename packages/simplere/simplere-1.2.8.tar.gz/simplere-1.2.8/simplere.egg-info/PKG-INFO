        A simplified interface to Python's regular expression (``re``) string
        search. Eliminates steps and provides simpler access to results. As a bonus,
        also provides compatible way to access Unix glob searches.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Python regular expressions are powerful, but the language's lack
        of an *en passant* (in passing) assignment requires a preparatory
        motion and then a test::
        
            import re
        
            match = re.search(pattern, some_string)
            if match:
                print match.group(1)
        
        With ``simplere``, you can do it in fewer steps::
        
            from simplere import *
        
            if match / re.search(pattern, some_string):
                print match[1]
        
        That's particularly valuable in complex search-and-manipulate
        code that requires multiple levels of searching along with
        pre-conditions, error checking, and post-match cleanup, formatting,
        and actions.
        
        As a bonus,
        ``simplere`` also provides simple glob access.::
        
            if 'globtastic' in Glob('glob*'):
                print "Yes! It is!"
            else:
                raise ValueError('OH YES IT IS!')
        
        It can also conveniently match against multiple glob
        patterns, and/or do case-insensitive glob searches.
        
        See `Read the Docs <http://simplere.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
        for the full installation and usage documentation.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        * Version 1.2.7 starts automated measurement of test branch coverage.
          Inital runs show 100% branch coverage. *Hooah!*
        
        * Version 1.2.6 bumps test coverage to 100%.
        
        * Version 1.2.5 added automated measurement of test coverage. Line coverage
          started at 92%. Bumped to 97%.
        
        * Version 1.2 extends auto-imported symbols. Previously
          overly restrictive, requiring clients of module
          to needlessly (and contra docs) manually import ``re`` and construct
          the ``match`` object.  Fixed.  Bumped minor version number to reflect
          *de facto* API change.
        
        * Version 1.1 adds multi-pattern and case insensitive Glob subclass.
          Added wheel packaging. Rearranged and extended testing structure.
          Updated setup and docs.
        
        * See ``CHANGES.rst`` for a fuller historical view of changes.
        
        * Automated multi-version testing managed with `pytest
          <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_ and `tox
          <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_. Continuous integration testing
          with `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/jonathaneunice/intspan>`_.
          Packaging linting with `pyroma <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyroma>`_.
        
          Successfully packaged for, and
          tested against, all late-model versions of Python: 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3,
          3.4, and 3.5 pre-release (3.5.0b3) as well as PyPy 2.6.0 (based on
          2.7.9) and PyPy3 2.4.0 (based on 3.2.5).

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install or upgrade to the latest version::
        
            pip install -U simplere
        
        To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::
        
            python3.3 -m easy_install --upgrade simplere
        
        (You may need to prefix these with ``sudo`` to authorize
        installation. In environments without super-user privileges, you may want to
        use ``pip``'s ``--user`` option, to install only for a single user, rather
        than system-wide.)
