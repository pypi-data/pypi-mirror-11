Description: ==========
        pythonbase
        ==========
        
        pythonbase provides a skeleton for creating Python projects, complete with Sphinx docs, PyPI integration, etc.
        
        Basic setup
        ===========
        
        #. Copy the directory structure and files of Pythonbase to your project.
        #. Make changes to all these files as necessary (e.g., by grep'ing for "pythonbase" and replacing with your project).
        #. Run ``python setup.py develop`` in your new project to install it on your system
        #. Run ``python setup.py release`` to release your project to PyPI. Congratulations, your project can now be installed!
        
        (The last step probably requires PyPI registration; fill in details once I get a good test case for a new user).
        
        Docs setup
        ==========
        
        #. Navigate to the ``pythonbase/docs`` directory
        #. Run ``sphinx-apidoc -o . -f ../pythonbase; make html``
        #. Go up one directory (``cd..``).
        #. Release docs: ``python setup.py upload_docs --upload-dir=docs/_build/html``
        
        CircleCI setup
        ==============
        
        #. Log into CircleCI, and build your project.
