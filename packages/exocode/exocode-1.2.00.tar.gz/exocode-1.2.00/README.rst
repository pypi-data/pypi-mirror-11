**ExoCode**

Generates .csv files including data on the existence of various features of interest 
from the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS), 2-micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and 
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) image catalogs. The goal is to use the 
data to identify candidates that might have circumstellar debris disks. 

This release includes catalogs tycho_2mass_wise-XMATCH-POS.csv (full catalog), RandSample+1000.csv,
RandSample+2000.csv, and tam_cat_sample.csv. Pre-downloaded images from tam_cat_sample.csv are available
for your convenience in FITS/Tam/. All other catalogs must first have images downloaded to be useful.

Dependent on scikit-image (skimage), matplotlib, numpy, and pyfits.
