Supervisor + Cron
=================

This is a fork of
`Supervisor <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor>`__ with the
addition of cron! The only difference is the addition of one extra
parameter that controls when a program is started again.

``[program:x]`` Section Values
------------------------------

``startintervalsecs``

After a program has exited, Supervisor will delay restarting the program
for the given number of seconds since the *last started* time. This can
be used to regularly schedule jobs.

*Default*: 0 - Restarting according to normal Supervisor convention

*Required*: No.

*Introduced*: in this fork!
