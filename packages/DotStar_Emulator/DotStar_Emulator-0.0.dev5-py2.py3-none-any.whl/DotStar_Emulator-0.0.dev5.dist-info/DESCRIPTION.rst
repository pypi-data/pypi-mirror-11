A simple emulator/simulator for the AdaFruit DotStar Strip Library.
This project allows for quicker development of DotStar controller
programs that you right, by not requiring you to have hardware
hooked up to your device. For example, you can program a Raspberry
pi controller from your normal PC using this.
