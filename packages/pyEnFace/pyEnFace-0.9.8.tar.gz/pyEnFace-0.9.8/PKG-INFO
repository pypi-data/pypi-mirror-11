Description: PyEnFace is a package used to interface with the Enphase Developer API
        
        It supports returning raw strings, dicts via json, pandas dataframes and 
        pandas dataframes that are cached via any engine supportable by sqlalchemy.
        
        Currently it is only supported with python 3.4, I intend to support all versions of python3 but I'm not sure it will be back ported to python 2 at this point in time.
        
        Originally the project was going to be called the lame name EnphaseInterface, but I soon realized how how much I didn't like the anti-open source Enphase products are so I... picked the first syllable of the first word and the last syllable of the last word mashed them together and added the letters py.  Why add py, because it is the proverbial python package extension.  PyEnFace kind of has a nice ring to it...
