Introduction
------------

pyethapp is the python based client implementing the Ethereum_ cryptoeconomic state machine.

Ethereum as a platform is focussed on enabling people to build new ideas using blockchain technology.

The python implementation aims to provide an easily hackable and extendable codebase.

pyethapp leverages two ethereum core components to implement the client:

* pyethereum_ - the core library, featuring the blockchain, the ethereum virtual machine, mining
* pydevp2p_ - the p2p networking library, featuring node discovery for and transport of multiple services over multiplexed and encrypted connections

.. _pydevp2p: https://github.com/ethereum/pydevp2p


Installation and invocation
---------------------------

* git clone https://github.com/ethereum/pyethapp
* cd pyethapp
* python setup.py install
* pyethapp      (shows help)
* pyethapp run  (starts the client)

There is also Dockerfile in the repo.

Invocation on the Frontier Main Net
-----------------------------------
In order to sync with the current live ethereum network, you need to provide some extra arguments. Note, that these will not be necessary in future releases.

```pyethapp -c eth.network_id=1 -c eth.genesis=/full/path/to/genesis_w_extradata.json run```

Warning: If you invoked pyethapp without above `eth.genesis` arg, then there is already a wrong genesis block in the chain. You'll need to delete your data directory (which is reported on startup). You can set a custom data directory with the `-d <path>` option.

`genesis_w_extradata.json` can be found in main dir of this repository.





Interacting
-----------

You can interact with the client using the JSONRPC api or directly on the console.

* https://github.com/ethereum/pyethapp/blob/master/pyethapp/rpc_client.py

Status
------

* Working PoC9 prototype
* interoperable with the go and cpp clients
* jsonrpc (mostly)





History
-------

0.1.0 (20150-1-1)
---------------------
