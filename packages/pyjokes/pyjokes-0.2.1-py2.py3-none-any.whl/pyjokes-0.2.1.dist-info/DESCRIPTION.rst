One line jokes for programmers (jokes as a service)

Installation
============

Install the `pyjokes` module with pip.

Python 3::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install pyjokes

or on some systems::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip-3.2 install pyjokes

Python 2::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install pyjokes

Usage
=====

Once installed, simply call `pyjoke` from the command line.

Alternatively use the `-c` flag to get jokes from a specific category. Options::

    -c neutral [default] (neutral geek jokes)
    -c explicit (explicit geek jokes)
    -c chuck (Chuck Norris geek jokes)
    -c all (all jokes)

You can also access the jokes in your own project by importing `pyjokes`. You have access to the `get_joke` function, the `jokes` list, and the joke catgeory lists separately: `geek_neutral`, `geek_explicit`, `chuck_nerdy`.
