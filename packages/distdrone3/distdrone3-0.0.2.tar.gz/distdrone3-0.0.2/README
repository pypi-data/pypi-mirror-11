This is the backbone of my (Isaac Robinson) high school research project. The idea is that drones have limited processing power and so cannot actually do very intensive tasks on their own. My solution to this problem was to make each drone borrow CPU time from other drones in a swarm when necessary. The method essentially changes the architecture of the system from a bunch of individual drones in a swarm to a computational cluster just long enough to get an intensive task done. This saves money, power, and makes it possible to use low-power drones for high-power tasks.

I chose to demonstrate this idea by creating a trigger which would alert a drone of the precense of something requiring more intensive processing, and then distributing this processing. For me, the intensive processing so far is facial detection. I have shown this method to be highly effective, and am currently in the process of improving it.

I am also building real drones to demonstrate this idea. My project is documented at sites.google.com/site/paralleldrone.
