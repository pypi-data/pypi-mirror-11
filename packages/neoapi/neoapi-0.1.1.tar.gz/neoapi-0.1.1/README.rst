summary
=======

NeoApi is an OGM built on top of NeoModel.  NeoApi Classes extend the StructuredNode from NeoModel by adding methods that allow each object to be easiy serialized into json api responses that comply with the standard on http://jsonapi.org.  With this framework your neo4j api will basically build itself!
