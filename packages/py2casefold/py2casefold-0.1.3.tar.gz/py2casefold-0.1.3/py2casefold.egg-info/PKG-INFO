Description: ``py2casefold``
        ===============
        
        Python 3 has ``str.casefold()``.  Python 2 doesn't.  ``py2casefold`` brings
        casefolding support to Python 2.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``pip install py2casefold``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
            >>> from py2casefold import casefold
            >>> print casefold(u"tschüß")
            tschüss
            >>> casefold(u"ΣίσυφοςﬁÆ") == casefold(u"ΣΊΣΥΦΟσFIæ") == u"σίσυφοσfiæ"
            True
        
        Note that ``casefold`` does *not* normalize the string.  Casefolding and normalization are different operations.  For more info see http://www.w3.org/International/wiki/Case_folding, and http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod-norm/.
        
        If you are looking for string similarity you will also probably want to consider one of the unicode normalization options (NFC, NFKC, NFD, NFKD) that are available with python's built in ``unicodedata.normalize()``.
