eGenix mxODBC Database Adaptor for Zope
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The eGenix mxODBC Database Adaptor for Zope (Zope DA) provides you
  with a professional quality ODBC interface which allows you to
  easily connect to ODBC data sources you have configured on your
  system via the Windows ODBC Manager on Windows 98 - XP or
  iODBC/unixODBC on Unix platforms.

  The mxODBC Zope DA package include everything you need to install
  the Zope DA: the latest egenix-mx-base and -mx-commercial packages
  as well as the Zope DA product itself.

  Features

    * Zope Level 3 Database Adapter: the mxODBC Zope DA is fully
      multi-threaded and can handle multiple connections to multiple
      databases.

    * Fully compatible to Z SQL Methods.

    * Fully compatible to the Znolk SQL Wizard Product and other similar
      products relying on the common database schema access methods
      .tables() and .columns().

    * Connection Pooling: physical database connections are pooled and
      kept open, to reduce the connection overhead to a minimum.  This is
      especially important for high latency database connections and ones
      like Oracle which take a considerable amount of time to setup

    * Parallel Execution of Queries on a single logical connection: the
      mxODBC Zope DA can manage any number of physical connections on a
      single logical connection. This enables running truly parallel Z SQL
      Method queries -- a feature not available in other Zope DAs.

    * Robust Mode of Operation: connections which have timed out or go
      away due to network problems are automatically reconnected.

    * Cross-platform Connection Objects: The Zope DA will automatically
      choose the right platform specific ODBC manager for you.

    * Per Connection Adjustable ODBC Interface: mxODBC comes with many
      different subpackages to choose from on Unix. The Zope DA allows you
      to select these subpackages on a per-connection basis.

    * Per Connection Error Handling: you can tell each connection whether
      it should report ODBC warnings or not; furthermore all warnings and
      errors are made available as list .messages on the DatabaseConnection
      object.

    * Transaction safe automatic reconnect: when the DA finds that a
      connection has timed out, it automatically tries a reconnect
      and replays the transaction on the connection (unlike other DAs
      which break the transaction scheme by doing a reconnect without
      replay).

    * Built-in Schema Cache: this results in improved performance under
      heavy load.

    * Database Schema Access: all ODBC catalog methods are made available
      for much better database schema inquiry. The catalog methods allow
      building generic database interrogation or manipulation tools and
      facilitates writing database independent Zope products.
