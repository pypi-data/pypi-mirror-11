Description: collective.recipe.nix
        =====================
        
        This is an experimental buildout recipe for creating nix expression from
        a buildout eggs list. This is work in progress. Please, contribute_.
        
        .. _contribute: https://github.com/datakurre/collective.recipe.nix
        
        The minimal buildout part should include ``recipe`` and ``eggs``:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
           [releaser]
           recipe = collective.recipe.nix
           eggs = zest.releaser[recommended]
        
        The recipe generates three kind of expressions:
        
        * mkDerivation based [name].nix usable with nix-shell and nix-build
        * buildEnv based [name]-env.nix usable with nix-build
        * buildPythonPackage based [name]-[package].nix usable with nix-env -i -f
        
        **Note:** For large projects like Plone, it's recommended to use a local
        mirrored package ``index`` / ``find-links`` to avoid connection issues when
        recipe is resolving each package fetchurl information. Possible remedies
        include setting ``allow-from-cache`` to ``true`` to allow recipe to use
        configured buildout download cache (and create ``file://`` urls), or just
        running the buildout again with help of recipe created cumulative cache
        (``[~/][.]collective.recipe.nix.cfg``).
        
        
        Recipe options
        --------------
        
        **eggs**
          list of packages to generate expressions for
        
        **name**
          string to define the name used in the resulting derivation and in the
          generated filenames (defaults to part name)
        
        **prefix**
          string to set prefix (or path) for generated outputs (defaults to working
          directory)
        
        **parts**
          list of existing buildout sections to install in mkDerivation based expression
          (defaults to all but the current section)
        
        **outputs**
          list of full generated expression filenames to filter outputs to be generated
          (defaults to nothing to generate all)
        
        **allow-from-cache**
          boolean (``true``) to allow generated expression to use package  from
          buildout download cache (defaults to ``false``)
        
        **build-inputs**
          list of additional build-inputs from nixpkgs for generated expressions (to be
          available in nix-shell environment) or list of ``package=nixpkgsPackage``
          mappings to inject build-inputs for each package's
          ``buildPythonPackage``-expression
        
        **propagated-build-inputs**
          list of ``package=other.package`` mappings to inject additional
          requirements for packages (usually to enable some additional features)
        
        **nixpkgs**
          list of ``package=pythonPackages.package`` mappings to use existing packages
          from nixpkgs instead of generating custom ``buildPythonPackage`` (useful with
          package like Pillow, which need additional care to get built properly)
        
        **urls**
          list of ``package=url#md5=hash`` mappings to explicitly define package
          download URL and MD5 checksum for cases where the recipe fails to resolve
          it automatically
        
        `See the project repository for configuration examples.`__

        Example of generic use
        ----------------------
        
        At first, define ``./default.nix`` with buildout::
        
            with import <nixpkgs> {}; {
              myEnv = stdenv.mkDerivation {
                name = "myEnv";
                buildInputs = [
                  libxml2
                  libxslt
                  pythonPackages.ldap
                  pythonPackages.pillow
                  pythonPackages.readline
                  pythonPackages.zc_buildout_nix
                ];
                shellHook = ''
                  export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/.nix-profile/etc/ca-bundle.crt
                '';
              };
            }
        
        And example ``./buildout.cfg``:
        
        .. code:: cfg
        
            [buildout]
            parts = releaser
        
            [releaser]
            recipe = collective.recipe.nix
            eggs = zest.releaser[recommended]
        
        Run the buildout:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nix-shell --run buildout-nix
        
        Now you should be able to run zest.releaser with recommended plugins with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nix-shell releaser.nix --run fullrelease
        
        Or install zest.releaser into your current Nix profile with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nix-env -i -f releaser-zest_releaser.nix

        Example of building Plone
        -------------------------
        
        Together with nixpkgs optimized buildout version (available in nixpkgs), this
        recipe can be used to build a Nix derivation using buildout install as in Nix
        derivation builder (see the generated mkDerivation based expression for
        current example implementation):
        
        .. code:: ini
        
           [buildout]
           extends = https://dist.plone.org/release/5-latest/versions.cfg
           parts = plone
           versions = versions
        
           [instance]
           recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
           eggs = Plone
           user = admin:admin
           var = /tmp
        
           [plone]
           recipe = collective.recipe.nix
           parts = instance
           eggs = ${instance:eggs}
           outputs = plone.nix
        
           [versions]
           Pillow =
           setuptools =
           zc.buildout =
           zc.recipe.egg =
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nix-shell --run buildout-nix
           $ nix-build plone.nix -o plone
           $ plone/bin/instance fg
