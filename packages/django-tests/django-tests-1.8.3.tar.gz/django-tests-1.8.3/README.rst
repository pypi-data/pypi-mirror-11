django-tests is an unofficial distribution of the Django test suite,
for third-party projects that have found it useful to build on the tests.

Neither the Django project, not the maintainers of this distribution promise
the test suite will have stable APIs. Django's test suite is not covered
by the project's deprecation policy. Functions, classes, modules and entire
packages will move or disappear at the drop of a patch release.

The version of this package will roughly correspond to the matching Django
version.
