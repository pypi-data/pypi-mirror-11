Name: collective.dualresources
Version: 0.2
Summary: An extension of the plone.resource plone:static zcml directive, that allows to specify two folders for a resource directory registration: A dev-directory and a dist-directory. When plone is running in debug mode the filesystem path specified in dev-directory is used to serve static resources for this resource registration. The dist-directory is used when not in debug mode. This allows to use tools like grunt to build production versions of resources, including minification, concatenation, image minification, etc.
