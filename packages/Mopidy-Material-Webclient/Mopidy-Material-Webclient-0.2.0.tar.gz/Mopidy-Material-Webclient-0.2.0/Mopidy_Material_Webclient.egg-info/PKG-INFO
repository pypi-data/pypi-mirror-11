        A Mopidy web client with an Android Material design feel.
        
        This is a stripped down and slightly tarted up web front end for my own personal use and a few people I make retro 
        radios into streaming music players for.  
        
        You won't see the wealth of settings that the brilliant `Mopidy Websettings <https://github.com/woutervanwijk/mopidy-websettings>`_ 
        gives you because this was created for people with pre-installed systems who won't be making that level of change. Maybe I'll add in 
        some meta settings to say which settings are accessible in a later update!
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running::
        
            pip install Mopidy-Material-Webclient
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Before starting Mopidy, you must add configuration for
        Mopidy-Material-Webclient to your Mopidy configuration file::
        
            [material-webclient]
        	enabled = true
        	config_file = /etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf

        Thanks
        ======
        
        - `Mopidy music server <http://mopidy.com>`_ which this is only a web front end for
        - A lot of the original code from the `Pi Musicbox <http://pimusicbox.com>`_ for settings and the orginal SD image I worked from
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        v0.2.0
        ----------------------------------------
        
        - Reworked searching from the library
        - Playing a track now inserts it into the current queue then plays it
        - Clear queue function
        - Lots of cleanup and linting of scripts
        
        v0.1.0
        ----------------------------------------
        
        - Initial release.
        - Lots of unnecessary files still in there from Bower, I'll add Grunt at some point to strip out the minified versions.
        - About and restart don't work at all from the System menu
        - Search produces results but you can't do anything with them.  I'm not happy with any of the search mechanic at the moment - so expect to see that entirely revamped.
        - Playlist support is really basic, just saving the current queue as a new playlist
