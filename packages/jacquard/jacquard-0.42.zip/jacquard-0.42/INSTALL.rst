Installing
----------
The easiest way to install Jacquard is through PyPI. Get pip if it's
not available in your system:

   $ pip install jacquard


You can install from source from github:

::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/umich-brcf-bioinf/Jacquard


If you don't have root permissions, you can install locally:

::

   $ pip install --user jacquard

.. note:: You may need to modify your path to include the Python install dir
         (e.g. /Users/<username>/.local/bin)
