Submitting a Bug
================

If you found a bug or any part of khal isn't working as you
expected, please check if that bug is not already reported at

https://github.com/geier/khal/issues?state=open

and report it otherwise.

Please run the command again with the -v option enabled and paste
the output of that (of course you can edit out any private
details like your username and resource).
