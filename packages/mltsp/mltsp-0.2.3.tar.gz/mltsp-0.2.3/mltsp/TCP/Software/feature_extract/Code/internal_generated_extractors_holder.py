glob_internally_generated_extractors = {} # 20080508: dstarr KLUDGE.  Nat's Lomb Scargle algorithms generate a bunch of features, which due to the current architecture, must be represented in seperate extractor objects that are available many stacks higher (to be added to a "signal_list").  Existing architecture assumed all extractors are explicitly defined (listed as ordered __init__.py imports), but this dynamic feature-extractor generation breaks this assumption.  So, I must use a global list which is accessible by signals_list related methods, and still updateable by the Nat-Lomb_scargle feature extractor.
