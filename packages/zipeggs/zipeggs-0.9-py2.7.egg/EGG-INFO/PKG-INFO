Description: Zipeggs
        -------
        
        Buildout when collecting eggs, always flattens out the eggs as directories. We had a requirement where the eggs are needed as zips not as dirs. So this recipe.
        This will take a folder as input, iterate through the folders in it and create zip archives out of all folders inside it.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Add the recipe as zipeggs
        2. Specify target=dir where you want the zipped eggs to be
        3. Specify source=dir the directory to find flattened eggs.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        [zip]
        recipe = zipeggs:zipeggs
        target = dist
        source = eggs
