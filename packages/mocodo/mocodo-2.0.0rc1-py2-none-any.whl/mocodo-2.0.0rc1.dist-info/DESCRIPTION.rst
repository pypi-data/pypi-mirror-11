Mocodo is an open-source tool for designing and teaching relational databases. It takes as an input a textual description of both entities and associations of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). It outputs a vectorial drawing in SVG and a relational schema in various formats (SQL, LaTeX, Markdown, etc.).
