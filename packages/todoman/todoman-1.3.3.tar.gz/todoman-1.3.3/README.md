Todoman
=======

Todoman is a simple, standards-based, [cli][1] todo (aka: task) manager. Todos
are stored into [icalendar][2] files, which means you can sync them via
[CalDAV][3] using, for example, [vdirsyncer][4].

Features
--------

 * Listing, editing and creating todos.
 * Todos are read from individual ics files from the configured directory. This
   matches the [vdir][vdir] specification.
 * There's support for the most common TODO features for now (summary,
   description, location, due date and priority) for now.
 * Todoman should run on any major operating system.
 * Unsupported fields may not be shown but are *never* deleted or altered.

Planned Features
----------------

 * Keep a SQL cache of all the entries, and update this only when the
   modification time of the ics files changes. This design is inspired
   (identical, really) to what khal does.
 * Interactive mode. Including a list of todos, and easy selection for marking
   done and editing.
 * Support for other icalendar fields which are not implemented yet.
 * Customizable output format.

Pull requests and patches are welcome! ðŸ˜‰ Please report any issues on the

Caveats
-------

Priority granularity hasn't been completely implemented yet. Icalendar
supports priorities 1-9 or none. Todoman supports only none or 1 (highest).

Due dates are generally shown and editable as dates with no time component.

Support for the `percent-completed` attribute is incomplete. Todoman can only
mark todos as completed (100%), and will nor reflect nor allow editing for
values for `percent > 0 ^ percent < 100`.

Requirements
------------

Running `setup.py` (as described below, in Installation) should install all
necessary dependencies via pip. The only pre-requisite for this is python 3,
which ships with most modern distributions.

 * python3 (tested on 3.4, should work on any version > 3.0)
 * docopt
 * icalendar
 * urwid
 * pyxdg
 * atomicwrites

Todoman will not work with python 2. However, keep in mind that python 2 and
python 3 can coexist (and most distributions actually ship both).

Installation
------------

If todoman is not in your distribution's repositories, to install it run
`python3 setup.py install`. 

Usage
-----

You'll need to configure Todoman first. Required values are a path where your
todos are stored and the date format you prefer. Check the
`todoman.conf.sample` file, which should serve as a reference.  
The configuration file should be placed in
`$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/todoman/todoman.conf`. `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR` will be `~/.config`
is most situations.

Usage is rather simple:

    todo
    todo new
    todo edit ID
    todo show ID
    todo help | -h | --help
    todo --version

When no arguments are passed, Todoman will list all todos, along with their
IDs. IDs are not immutable, and will change as you add/delete new entries.

Sample output:

    Output sample:
    [ ] ! 2015-04-30 Close bank account (0%)
    [ ] !            Send minipimer back for warranty replacement (0%)
    [X]   2015-03-29 Buy soy milk (100%)
    [ ]              Fix the iPad's screen (0%)
    [ ]              Fix the Touchad battery (0%)

If you want to synchronize your todos, you'll needs something that syncs via
CalDAV. [vdirsyncer](https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer) is the
recommended tool for this.

Color and displayname
---------------------

- You can set a color for each task list by creating a `color` file containing
  a colorcode in the format `#RRGGBB`.
- A file named `displayname` decides how the task list should be named. The
  default is the directory name.

vdirsyncer](https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer/issues/125).

Interactive shell
-----------------

If you install [click-repl](https://github.com/untitaker/click-repl), todoman
gets a new command called `repl`, which lauches an interactive shell with
tab-completion.
