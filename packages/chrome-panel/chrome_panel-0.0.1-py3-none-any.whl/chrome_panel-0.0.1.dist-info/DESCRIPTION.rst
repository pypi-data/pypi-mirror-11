chrome_panel
============

chrome_panel will be a replacement for debug_toolbar.
Instead of modifieing the page the debug output will be shown in a chrome extension.

The chrome extension will add a header to the request to enable debugging. The webapp will add a header to the response with basic information and a link to get more data.

this is pre alpha testing stuff.

some code is directly taken from [django\_debug\_toolbar](https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar) to get testing started.

this stuff is like django and django\_debug\_toolbar under BSD license.
