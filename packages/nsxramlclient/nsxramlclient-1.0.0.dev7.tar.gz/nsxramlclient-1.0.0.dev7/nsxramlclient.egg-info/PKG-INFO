Description: nsxramlclient
        =============
        
        This somewhat dynamic client gets its API structure information (e.g.
        URLs, paramaters, schemas, etc.) from a RAML file.
        
        It is curently in development, more documentation in this readme will
        follow soon
        
        How to install
        ==============
        
        The following install instructions will focus on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but
        installations on other Linux distributions or on MAC should be
        relatively simmilar.
        
        Check wether pip is installed
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip --version
        
        If pip is not installed, install it with apt-get
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
        
        Now you can install the nsx raml client using pip
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sudo pip install nsxramlclient --pre
        
        If the installation fails because of missing dependencies of lxml, you
        will see the following message
        
        ::
        
            ERROR: /bin/sh: 1: xslt-config: not found
            ** make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed **
        
        In this case install the following packages through apt-get, and then
        repeat the above pip installation of the nsx raml client:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev zlib1g-dev
