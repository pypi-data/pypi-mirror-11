Introduction
============

.. begin

``griffin`` is an Apache 2.0-licensed documentation generator written in Python
leveraging the `RAMLfications`_ library to create API docs from `RAML`_.

If you’ve never heard of `RAML`_, you’re missing out:

    RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs.
    It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices.
    The goal is to help our current API ecosystem by solving immediate problems and then encourage ever-better API patterns.
    RAML is built on broadly-used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec.
