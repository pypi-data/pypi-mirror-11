Description: Engineering Hamiltonians through Nonlinearities
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        Following the formalism described in "Black-box superconducting circuit
        quantization" http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0587 we can expand `sin(a+b+...+h.c.)`
        or `cos(a+b+...+h.c.)` or any other nonlinear `f(a+b+...+h.c.)` in order to
        obtain non-linear terms in the Hamiltonian (a, b, and other letters represent
        the annihilation operators of various oscillator modes). If we drive some of
        the modes classically we can create any non-linear term in the effective
        Hamiltonian. This module helps solve the constraint on the frequencies of the
        modes (both the requirement that some of the monomials in the expansion are
        resonant and that all the other terms in the expansion of the nonlinearity are
        off-resonant).
