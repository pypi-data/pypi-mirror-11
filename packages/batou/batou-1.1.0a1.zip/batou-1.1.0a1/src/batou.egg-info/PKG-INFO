Description: batou
        =====
        
        batou helps you to automate your application deployments:
        
        * You create a model of your deployment using a simple but powerful Python API.
        * You configure how the model applies to hosts in different environments.
        * You verify and run the deployment with the batou utility.
        
        Getting started with a new project is easy::
        
            $ mkdir myproject
            $ cd myproject
            $ curl https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/batou/.../bootstrap-template -o batou
            $ chmod +x batou
            $ ./batou
        
        Here's a minimal application model::
        
            $ mkdir -p components/myapp
            $ cat > components/myapp/component.py
            from batou.component import Component
            from batou.lib.python import VirtualEnv, Package
            from batou.lib.supervisor import Program
        
            class MyApp(Component):
        
                def configure(self):
                    venv = VirtualEnv('2.7')
                    self += venv
                    venv += Package('myapp')
                    self += Program('myapp',
                        command='bin/myapp')
        
        And here's a minimal environment::
        
            $ mkdir environments
            $ cat > environments/dev.cfg
            [environment]
            mode = local
        
            [hosts]
            localhost = myapp
        
        To deploy this, you run::
        
            $ ./batou deploy dev
        
        Check the `detailed documentation <http://batou.readthedocs.org>`_ to get going with a more ambitious project.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Separate your application model from environments
        * Supports idempotent operation for incremental deployments
        * Deploy to multiple hosts simultaneously
        * Automated dependency resolution for multi-host
          scenarios
        * No runtime requirements on your application
        * Encrypted secrets with multiple access levels: store your
          SSL certificates, SSH keys, service secrets and more to get true 1-button deployments.
        * Deploy to local machines, Vagrant, or any SSH host
        * Broad SSH feature support by using OpenSSH through execnet
        * Only few dependencies required on the remote host
        * Ships with a library of components for regularly needed
          tasks
        * self-bootstrapping and self-updating - no additional
          scripting needed

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1.0a1 (2015-09-03)
        ====================
        
        - Do request an update for packages installed from requirements.txt within
          the batou environment to help update VCS checkouts that are pinned.
        
        - Clear PYTHONPATH for bootstrapping to avoid accidental interaction with
          unclean Python environments.
        
        - Provide '--fast' mode: do not perform bootstrapping.
        
          This is a first step to improve bootstrapping times. The switch is rather dumb but allows us to work a) offline
          in some cases and b) develop faster.
        
        - Fix unicode encoding/decoding in File handling. See #14944.
          (Ported from 1.0)
        
        - Fold the runner invocation for `local` and `remote` into
          a single `deploy` command:
        
          $ ./batou deploy <environment>
        
          To force a local or remote invocation use --local and --remote. By default batou will assume a remote environment. To configure an environment's deployment mode use the `mode` attribute in the `environment` section::
        
              [environment]
              mode = local
        
          To specify a manual override on the commandline you can provide the `--local` or `--remote` arguments to the `run` command.
        
        - Improve bootstrapping to give developers a better way
          to get started without installing batou system-wide
          or in a temporary virtualenv.
        
        - Revamp README and documentation.
        
        - Rework error handling and output management.
        
          batou will now show more errors at once, suppress unnecessary internal tracebacks and try to prioritize
          different errors to make complex failure situations
          easier to ingest.
