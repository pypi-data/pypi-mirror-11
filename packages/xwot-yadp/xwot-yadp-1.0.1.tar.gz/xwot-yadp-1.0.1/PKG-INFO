Description: Yadp - Yet Another Discovery Protocol
        -------------------------------------
        Yadp is a prototype implementation of a Discovery Protocol.
        
           1) It allows to carry user-defined payload data.
           2) It's line oriented protocol and looks like HTTP.
           3) It allows to carry meta headers to encode the content-type of the user-defined payload data,
              a location header to retrieve more information about the discovered service.
