Welcome to qiita's documentation!
=================================

Qiita (canonically pronounced cheetah) is a software package intended for
analysis and administration of multi-omics datasets.

Qiita provides a free and open platform for users to: Easily share and reuse
existing data-sets in the form of studies. Perform analyses (by combining one
or more studies/data-sets) using published and unpublished data that meet the
standards as described by this documentation.  Easily interface with the EBI
repository for automated deposition. Query and interact with Qiita data
programmatically.

If you intend to use Qiita at the `central deployment
<http://qiita.microbio.me>`__ we recommend that you have a look at the
