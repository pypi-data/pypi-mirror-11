# IPython Kernel for Jupyter

This package provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter.

## Installation from source

1. `git clone`
2. `cd ipykernel`
3. `pip install --pre -e .`

 
The `--pre` will only be needed while we haven't released IPython 4. Once that's done, it will never be needed again. `--pre` isn't needed if you already have IPython from master.

After that, all normal `ipython` commands will use this newly-installed version of the kernel.
