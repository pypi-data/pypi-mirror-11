Description: 
        [vt102](http://github.com/samfoo/vt102) is an in memory vt1xx terminal
        emulator. It supports all the most common terminal escape sequences, including
        text attributes and color. 
        
        It's an in memory vt1XX-compatible terminal emulator. The *XX* stands for a
        series video terminals, developed by
        [DEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) between 1970
        and 1995. The first, and most famous one, was VT100 terminal, which is now a
        de-facto standard for all virtual terminal emulators.
        [vt102](http://github.com/samfoo/vt102) is one such emulator.
        
        Why would you want to use a terminal emulator?
        
        * Screen scraping some terminal or curses app.
        * Writing your own graphical terminal emulator.
        * ... seriously, that's about it.
        
        Here's a quick example:
        
            >>> from vt102 import screen, stream
            >>> st = stream()
            >>> sc = screen((10, 10))
            >>> print(sc)
            ["          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          "]
            >>> sc.attach(st)
            >>> st.process("Text goes here")
            >>> print(sc)
            ["Text goes ",
             "here      ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          ",
             "          "]
            >>> st.process("\x1b[H\x1b[K")
            >>> print(sc)
            ["          ",
