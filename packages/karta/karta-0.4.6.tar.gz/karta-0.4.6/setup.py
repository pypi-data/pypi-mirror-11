Karta - tidy package for geospatial computation
===============================================

*Karta* is a simple and fast framework for spatial analysis in Python.

Components:

- Clean geographically-aware vector and gridded data types
- Integration with pyproj to support a wide range of coordinate systems and
  transformations
- A selection of geographical analysis methods including geodetic length and
  area calculations, intersections, convex hulls, raster sampling and profiling,
  and grid warping
- IO for several common geographical formats, including GeoJSON, shapefiles
  (through pyshp), ESRI ASCII, and GeoTiff (through GDAL). Vector geometries
  implement ``__geo_interface__``.

*Karta* works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.
