Introduction
============
You can use ``syncrypto`` to encrypt a folder to another folder which contains the
corresponding encrypted content.

The most common scenario is\:

.. code-block::

                         syncrypto                         syncrypto
  plaintext folder A  <-------------> encrypted folder B <-----------> plaintext folder C
    in machine X                       in cloud storage                 in machine Y

The files in encrypted folder B are encrypted, so you can store it in any unsafe
environment, such as cloud service(Dropbox/OneDrive), USB storage or any other
storage that you can not control.

Each plaintext file has a corresponding encrypted file in the encrypted folder,
so if you modify one file in plaintext folder, there will be only one file
modified in the encrypted folder after synchronization. This make sure the
synchronization only changes the necessary content in encrypted folder, and is
very useful for file based cloud storage service to synchronizing minimal contents.

The synchronization is two-way, files not only syncing from plain text folder to
encrypted folder, but also syncing from encrypted folder to plain text folder.
``syncrypto`` will choose the newest file.

``syncrypto`` never delete files, if files or folders should be deleted or over
written by the syncing algorithm, ``syncrypto`` just move the files or folders
to the trash, the trash in encrypted folder located at _syncrypto/trash,
at .syncrypto/trash in plaintext folder. Files in encrypted folder's trash are
also encrypted. You can delete any files in trash in any time if you make sure
the files in it are useless or you can recover it from trash.


Installation
============

``syncrypto`` supports both python 2 and python 3, and is tested_ in:

.. _tested: https://travis-ci.org/liangqing/syncrypto

* python 2.6
* python 2.7
* python 3.3
* python 3.4

and it support all OS platforms(Linux, MacOSX, Windows) that python support

you can install it by pip_:

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install syncrypto


Usage
=====

Synchronization
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

    syncrypto [encrypted folder] [plaintext folder]

it will prompt you to input a password, if the encrypted folder is empty, 
the input password will be set to the encrypted folder, or it will be used
to verify the password you set before.

Notice that the first argument is encrypted folder, and the second one is
plaintext folder


Add rule for Synchronization
----------------------------

If you want ignore files while synchronizing, you can add rule\:

.. code-block:: bash

    syncrypto [encrypted folder] [plaintext folder] --rule 'ignore: name match *.swp'

the command above ignores files which name matches \*.swp

You can add rules multiple times\:

.. code-block:: bash

    syncrypto [encrypted folder] [plaintext folder] --rule 'include: name eq README.md' --rule 'ignore: name match *.md'

the command above ignores files matching "\*.md" but includes files named "README.md".

The rules are ordered, it means that the rules in front have higher priority than
later, if a rule matches, the matching process will returned immediately.

You can add rules in a file looks like\:

.. code-block::

    include: name eq README.md

    # ignore all markdown files, this is a comment
    ignore: name match *.md

and use the rules by "--rule-file" option:

.. code-block:: bash

    syncrypto [encrypted folder] [plaintext folder] --rule-file [rule file path]

the default rule file path is "[plaintext folder]/.syncrypto/rules", so you can
add rules in "[plaintext folder]/.syncrypto/rules", and don't need specify the
"--rule-file" option explicitly.

If you give some rules in command line, and write some rules in rule file at
the same time, the rules in command line will have higher priority than rules
in file.

The format of a rule:

.. code-block::

    [action]: [file attribute] [operand] [value]

``action`` can be ``include``, ``exclude``, ``ignore``

``include`` means the file matching the rule will syncing, ``exclude`` means the
file matching the rule will not syncing.

``ignore`` equals ``exclude``.

``syncrypto`` supports a lot of file attributes while matching rules, the complete
list is:

* ``name``, the name of the file, include file extension.
* ``path``, the relative path from the root of the plaintext folder.
* ``size``, the size of the file
* ``ctime``, the change time of the file, (in windows, it is creation time)
* ``mtime``, the modification time of the file

operands:

* ``eq``, ``==``
* ``gt``, ``>``
* ``lt``, ``<``
* ``gte``, ``>=``
* ``lte``, ``<=``
* ``ne``, ``!=``, ``<>``
* ``match``, match by glob, for example, "\*.md" matches all files end with "md"
* ``regexp``, perform a regular expression match

The unit of value in ``size`` rules are "byte" by default, you can also use
"K", "M" "G", for example specify the value "2K" means 2046 bytes

The format of value in ``ctime``, ``mtime`` is "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

Change the password
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    syncrypto --change-password [encrypted folder]

change the password of the encrypted folder
