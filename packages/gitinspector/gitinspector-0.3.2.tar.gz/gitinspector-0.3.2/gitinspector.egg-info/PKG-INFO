Description: gitnspector is a statistical analysis tool for git repositories.
        
        The defaut analysis shows general statistics per author, which can be
        complemented with a timeline analysis that shows the workload and activity of
        each author. Under normal operation, it filters the results to only show
        statistics about a number of given extensions and by default only includes
        source files in the statistical analysis.
        
        This tool was originally written to help fetch repository statistics from
        student projects in the course Object-oriented Programming Project
        (TDA367/DIT211) at Chalmers University of Technology and Gothenburg University.
        
        - Shows cumulative work by each author in the history.
        - Filters results by extension (default: java,c,cpp,h,hpp,py,glsl,rb,js,sql).
        - Can display a statistical timeline analysis.
        - Scans for all filetypes (by extension) found in the repository.
        - Multi-threaded; uses multiple instances of git to speed up analysis.
        - Supports HTML, XML and plain text (terminal) output.
