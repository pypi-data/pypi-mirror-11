Description: WAD - Web application detector
        ==============================
        
        |Build Status| |PyPI|
        
        WAD lets you analyze given URL(s) and detect technologies used by web
        application behind that URL, from the OS and web server level, to the
        programming platform and frameworks, as well as server- and client-side
        applications, tools and libraries.
        
        For example, results of scan of server might include:
        
        -  OS: Windows, Linux...
        -  Web server: Apache, Nginx, IIS...
        -  Programming platform: PHP, Python, Ruby, Java...
        -  Content management systems: Drupal, WordPress...
        -  Frameworks: AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Django...
        -  various databases, analytics tools, javascript libaries, CDNs,
           comment systems, search engines and many others.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        WAD is built as a standalone application, using
        `Wappalyzer <https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer>`__'s detection
        rules. It sends a GET request to the given URL and analyzes both HTTP
        response header and body (HTML page), looking for indications to
        discover web technologies used.
        
        Detection results may include information about versions of technologies
        used, for example Linux distro or Apache version. Results are
        categorized depending on type of technology (whether it is CMS or
        database etc.). There are now over 700 technologies that can be
        discovered using WAD.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        `WAD is available via PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wad>`__, so in
        order to install it, you simply need to run following command:
        
        ``pip install wad``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use ``wad -h`` to print help text. JSON is used for convenient
        formatting of output data. ### Example usage scenario Command:
        ``wad -u https://pypi.python.org/``
        
        Output:
        
        ::
        
            {
                "https://pypi.python.org/pypi": [
                    {
                        "type": "cache-tools", 
                        "app": "Varnish", 
                        "ver": null
                    }, 
                    {
                        "type": "web-servers", 
                        "app": "Nginx", 
                        "ver": "1.6.2"
                    }
                ]
            }
        
        Differences between WAD and Wappalyzer
        --------------------------------------
        
        Although most of the rules matching functionality is simply a Python
        port of Wappalyzer's javascript implementation, there are some key
        differences between projects.
        
        First of all, Wappalyzer (as an extension) runs on top of web browser,
        which means that the scripts on scanned site were ran, so variables and
        objects are created and accessible. Unfortunately, this isn't and won't
        be a case for WAD. WAD parses raw site content (as delivered by HTTP
        response), without running it in browser context. The consequences of
        that are simple - we can't use Wappalyzer's rules, that search for
        variables and objects in Javascript environment.
        
        Secondly, the project has and will continue to naturally diverge from
        Wappalyzer's codebase. We don't aim to make one-to-one port of
        Wappalyzer project and with intention to move to BeautifulSoup as DOM
        inspector (instead of blindly parsing the website with regex), we won't
        be able to assure same behaviour in every case.
        
        Finally, additional features added into WAD project aren't ported into
        Wappalyzer at the same time.
