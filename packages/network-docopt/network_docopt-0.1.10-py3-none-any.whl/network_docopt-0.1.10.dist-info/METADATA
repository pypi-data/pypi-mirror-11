network-docopt
==============

NetworkDocopt is a command line argument parser for networking focused
applications. This was heavily inspired by the docopt module at
http://docopt.org/ (no code from docopt was used however). The key
differences are:

-  Support for partial command line options. If your program foo has a
   "foo show summary" option you can also enter "foo sh sum"

-  Support for integration into bash's auto-complete mechanism

Example
=======

-  See network-docopt-example for an example of how to use this module
-  For bash <tab> auto-completion and bash <tab><tab> "show me available
   options" you must create a small bash script in
   /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ like so:
-  cp completions/network-docopt-example
   /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/

This bash script will call network-docopt-example with 'options' as the
last argument. For instance if you type "network-docopt-example show ip
" the bash script will call "network-docopt-example show ip options"
which will return "route" and "interface". This tells bash what the next
options are.
