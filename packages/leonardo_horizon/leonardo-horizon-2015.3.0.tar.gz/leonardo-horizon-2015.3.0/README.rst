OpenStack Horizon
=================

This is not my code ! Why i created this package ? Because we need only Horizon without Openstack Dashboard dependencies !

Installing from git about 10min and 50Mb is past

**Now we have 500Kb +- on pypi ready to use anywhere !**

Plan for this repository is only follow main openstack project and propagate stable version of Horizon for us.

Now is there **stable/kilo** and development version from master, but we recommend using ``stable/kilo``

.. code-block::

    pip install leonardo-horizon

Horizon is a Django-based project aimed at providing a complete OpenStack
Dashboard along with an extensible framework for building new dashboards
from reusable components. The ``openstack_dashboard`` module is a reference
implementation of a Django site that uses the ``horizon`` app to provide
web-based interactions with the various OpenStack projects.
