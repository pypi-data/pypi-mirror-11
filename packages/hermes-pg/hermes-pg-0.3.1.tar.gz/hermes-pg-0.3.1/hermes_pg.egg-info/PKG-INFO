Description: Hermes
        =======
        Hermes is a Postgres-talking, event-driven, failure-handling Python library.
        Its main purpose is to enable the easy implementation of resilient Python
        processes which require communication with Postgres. It defines a base-layer
        which you can build as little or as much as you like on top of.
        
        It's been used at `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_ to fulfil a number of roles, one of them
        including a Postgres -> Elasticsearch river.
