SparklingPandas
==============

SparklingPandas aims to make it easy to use the distributed computing power
of PySpark to scale your data analysis with Pandas. SparklingPandas builds on
Spark's DataFrame class to give you a polished, pythonic, and Pandas-like API.

Documentation
=========

See [SparklingPandas.com.](http://sparklingpandas.com/)

Videos
=========
An early version of Sparkling Pandas was discussed in [Sparkling Pandas - using 
Apache Spark to scale Pandas - Holden Karau and Juliet Hougland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcyI_V8FeIU)

Requirements
=========

The primary requirement of SparklingPandas is that you have a recent (v1.4
currently) version of Spark installed - <http://spark.apache.org> and Python
2.7.

Using
=========

Make sure you have the SPARK_HOME environment variable set correctly, as
SparklingPandas uses this for including the PySpark libraries

Other than that you can install SparklingPandas with pip and just import it.

State
=========

This is in early development. Feedback is taken seriously and is seriously appreciated.
As you can tell, us SparklingPandas are a pretty serious bunch.
