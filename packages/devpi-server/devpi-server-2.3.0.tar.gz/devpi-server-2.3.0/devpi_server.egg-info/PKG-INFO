        consistent robust pypi-cache
        ----------------------------------------
        
        You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
        index, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted
        **and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and
        greatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when
        offline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.
        
        github-style indexes
        ---------------------------------
        
        Each user can have multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via
        standard ``setup.py`` invocations.  Users, indexes (and soon projects
        and releases) are manipulaed through a RESTful HTTP API.
        
        index inheritance
        --------------------------
        
        Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
        both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
        index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
        release candidate before you push it to PyPI.
        
        good defaults and easy deployment
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
        including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. 
        
        separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        The complimentary `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/devpi-client>`_ tool
        helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
        installation workflows.
        
        See http://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.3.0
        ----------
        
        - switched to semantic versioning. Only major revisions will ever require an
          export/import cycle.
        
        - fix issue260: Log identical upload message on level "info"
        
        - Log upload trigger message on level "warn"
        
        - The PyPI changelog isn't watched for changes anymore.
          Instead we cache release data for 30 minutes, this can be adjusted with the
          ``--mirror-cache-expiry`` option.
        
        - fix issue251: Require and validate the "X-DEVPI-SERIAL" from master in
          replica thread
        
        - fix issue258: fix FileReplicationError representation for proper logging
        
        - fix issue256: if a project removes all releases from pypi or the project is
          deleted on pypi, we get a 404 back. In that case we now return an empty list
          of releases instead of returning an UpstreamError.
        
        - Change nginx template to serve HEAD in addition to GET requests of files
          directly instead of proxying to devpi-server
        
        - make keyfs cache size configurable via "--keyfs-cache-size" option and
          increase the default size to improve performance for installations with many
          writes
        
        
        2.2.2 (2015-07-09)
        ------------------
        
        - make replica thread more robust by catching more exceptions
        
        - Remove duplicates in plugin version info
        
        - track timestamps for event processing and replication and expose in /+status
        
        - implement devpiweb_get_status_info hook for devpi-web >= 2.4.0 status messages
        
        - UPGRADE NOTE: if devpi-web is installed, you have to request
          ``application/json`` for ``/+status``, or you might get a html page.
        
        - address issue246: refuse uploading release files if they do not
          contain the version that was transferred with the metadata of
          the upload request.
        
        - fix issue248: prevent change of index type after creation
        
        
        2.2.1 (2015-05-20)
        ------------------
        
        - fix issue237: fix wrong initial replica setup which would prevent
          initialization.  Thanks Stephan Erb.
        
        
        2.2.0 (2015-05-13)
        ------------------
        
        - add "--no-events" option to postpone running events after import
          to server start
        
        - add new ``devpiserver_get_credentials`` plugin hook to extract credentials
          from request
        
        - fix issue216: use sha256 instead of md5 checksums for serving own files
          (BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: needs export/import)
        
        - parse arbitrary checksums from PyPI in preparation for 
          a pending change on pypi.python.org which will see 
          it serving sha256 checksums only.
        
        - fix debug logging to actually show debug logs
          (logging was not properly reconfigured)
        
        - make logging fully configurable via a config yaml/json
          (e.g., log to an external syslog server)
        
        - fix issue221: avoid looking at file entries who are not part of a project
          (because they got deleted)
        
        - fix issue217: systematically avoid using bytes in persisted dictionaries 
          to avoid any py2/py3 bytes/unicode issue.
        
        - show actual instead of prospective replica serial in master /+status page 
        
        - fix issue165: make off-line serving more robust when we know there is
          a change but pypi is currently not reachable (just serve the old cached
          links and issue an error to the logs)
        
        - fix flaky devpi-server "--start" startup detection which would
          previously assume success if another server was already running on
          the address/port we want to run on. 
        
        - fix importing of indexes with custom_data and importing of
          documentation which follows uncommon package naming
        
        - fix issue228: when a stage is deleted don't veriy if it was root/pypi
          because you cannot delete root/pypi anyway.
        
        - fix issue232: pypi-refresh now works better for projects which have  
          have a non-nomalized projectname, and also works better across replication.
        
        - add new ``devpiserver_indexconfig_defaults`` plugin hook to add key names for
          settings in the index configuration.
        
        - add new ``devpiserver_on_upload_sync`` plugin hook and use it to move the
          Jenkins triggering to the ``devpi-jenkins`` plugin.
        
        - rename hooks: ``devpiserver_auth_credentials`` to
          ``devpiserver_get_credentials`` and ``devpiserver_run_commands`` to
          ``devpiserver_cmdline_run``.
        
        - add ``--hard-links`` option to use hard links for releases and doc zips
          during export.
        
        - speed up detecting replica/master mismatches and let a replica
          instantly die if it talks to a master that doesn't match the
          master id the replica is operating for.
        
        
        2.1.5 (2015-03-16)
        ------------------
        
        - fix devpi-ldap issue17: the push command directly used the username instead
          of using a general permission check, that caused groups in acl_upload to not
          be honored.
        - fix issue171: "devpi push" of an existing package fails on non volatile index
          and overwrites on volatile.
        - before devpi-server 2.1.5 it was possible to upload multiple documentation
          zip files for the same package version if the filename differed in case, this
          broke export and replication of server state and the documentation view.
          Now the newest upload will be used and older ones ignored.
        
        - fix issue217: try harder to avoid using "bytes" in python2 to allow
          py2/py3 master/replica setups and generally have more type-uniform bytes.
