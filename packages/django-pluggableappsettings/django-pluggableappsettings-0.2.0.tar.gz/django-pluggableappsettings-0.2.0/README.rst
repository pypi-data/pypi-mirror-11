django-pluggableappsettings
===========================

This app provides a baseclass to easily realize AppSettings for any
django project. The advantage of using an AppSettings class lies in the
possibility for the programmer to assign default values for settings if
the setting is not present in the main settings.py

**Attention:** The project is fairly new and not stable yet.

Quick start
-----------

1. Install django-pluggableappsettings

   -  From the pip repository:
      ``pip install django-pluggableappsettings``
   -  or directly from github:
      \`\ ``pip install git+git://github.com/NB-Dev/django-pluggableappsettings.git``

2. Create your AppSettings class in any of your project's files. E.g. in
   'app\_settings.py'.

3. Define your settings by setting the class attributes as one of the
   provided settings types

   ::

       from django_pluggableappsettings import AppSettings, Setting

       class MyAppSettings(AppSettings):
           MY_SETTING = Setting('DEFAULT_VALUE')

4. Access the setting from anywhere:

   ::

       from app_settings import MyAppSettings
       setting = MyAppSettings.MY_SETTING

Provided Setting Types
----------------------

Three different setting types are provided with the package:

Setting
~~~~~~~

The most basic setting that simply returns the value from the
settings.py or, if that is not set, the default value. If no default
value is provided and the setting is not set in your settings.py, an
``AttributeError`` is thrown.

CallableSetting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Behaves as a Setting but checks whether the value is callable and calls
it if possible before returning.

**Attention:** As each setting is only loaded once and then stored in a
cache, the call is only performed on the first access of the setting.

ClassSetting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Behaves as a Setting but accepts only Classes or dotted paths to classes
as values. If the value is a dotted path, the path is translated to a
class before returning, so the returned value is always a class.

Accessing Values
----------------

You can access any setting by simply importing your AppSettings class
and accessing the corresponding attribute.

Running the tests
-----------------

The included tests can be run standalone by running the
``tests/runtests.py`` script. You need to have Django and mock installed
for them to run. If you also want to run coverage, you need to install
it before running the tests

CHANGELOG
---------

v.0.2.0
~~~~~~~

-  Added the changelog
-  Redesign of settings to allow different types of settings that can
   now also provide type checking.
-  Settings are now explicitly defined and no ``_DEFAULT_`` prefix is
   needed anymore
-  Also no staticmethod decorator is needed anymore
