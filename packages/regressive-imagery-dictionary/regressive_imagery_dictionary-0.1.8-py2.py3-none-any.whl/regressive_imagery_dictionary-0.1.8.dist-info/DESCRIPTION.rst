"The Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) is a coding scheme for text analysis
that is designed to measure 'primordial' and conceptual content. Primordial
thought is the kind of free-form, associative thinking involved in fantasy
and dreams. Like Freud's id, I guess. Conceptual (or secondary) thought is
logical, reality-based and focused on problem solving."
