   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to reschema's documentation!
====================================

``reschema`` is a library for parsing reschema service definition
objects that describe a REST API.  The service defintion format is
described in fully in :doc:`specification`.  The package includes
tools for load and processing service definitions, generating API
documentation, and validating data according to schemas defined in the
service defintion.

Quick example:

.. code-block:: python

   # Load a service definition for a 'Bookstore' service
   >>> bookstore_def = ServiceDef.create_from_file('bookstore.yaml')

   # Get the 'author' resource
   >>> author_res = bookstore_def.resources['author']

   # Define an author and validate that the format is correct
   >>> author = dict(id=5, name='John Doe')
   >>> author_res.validate(author)

This Python module is useful for processing service definition files,
but it is frequently used in conjunction with ``sleepwalker``, another
module that provides a simple interface for interacting with servers
that implement services according to a reschema-based service definition.
