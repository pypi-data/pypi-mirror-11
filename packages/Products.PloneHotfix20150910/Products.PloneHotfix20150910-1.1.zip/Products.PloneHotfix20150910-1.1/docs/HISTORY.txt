Changelog
=========

1.1 (2015-09-10)
----------------

- Update release information to not include "arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation"
  wording as there are no patches related to that here. Bad copy, paste from last patch.

  If you have version 1.0, there is no reason to upgrade to 1.1. This release is just to update
  the readme shipped with the hotfix.
