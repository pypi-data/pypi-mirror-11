Prior changes belong to the FGo! program by Robert 'erobo' Leda and are listed
in the file 'ChangeLog.FGo'.

******************************************************************************

1.0.0
[FEATURE] Import the code from FGo! 1.5.5 onwards (Python 2 at that time)
          into a Git repository. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Port the code to Python 3. (Robert)
[FEATURE] Add the file docs/INSTALL/INSTALL_en to guide users through the
          process of installing the dependencies. (Florent Rougon)
[BUGFIX]  Fix typo in "help_it" file. (Philip Lacroix)
[FEATURE] Add conditional config based on CondConfigParser. This is
          documented for FGo! users in docs/README.conditional-config/.
          (Florent Rougon)
[BUGFIX]  Fix logic behind the Reset button. (Robert)
[FEATURE] Add keyboard shortcuts for "Run FG" (Ctrl-f), "Reset" (Ctrl-r) and
          "Save & Quit" (Ctrl-q). (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Move the "FG is running..." message from the separate "info" window
          to the main window. (Florent Rougon)

    * The separate window was annoying, because when switching from a
    workspace with FlightGear on top and FGo! below, to another workspace and
    back to the initial workspace, the "FG is running..." little window
    appeared on top of FlightGear, which prevented the user from controlling
    it until he explicitely switched to FlightGear's window.

    * The "FG is running..." message is now displayed in red in FGo!'s main
    window (in a Label widget) instead of the separate InfoWindow. When
    FlightGear is not running, this message is replaced by a "Ready"
    indication in green.

    * This new behaviour allows to interact with FGo! while FlightGear is
    running, except for the things that rely on stuff started in
    App.startLoops(). Among others, it makes it possible to modify the
    configuration before the fgfs process is completely terminated. It would
    be possible to keep the loops running even after FlightGear has been
    started, but that would sacrifice a small amount of performance, for IMHO
    very little benefit. I prefer freeing the CPU as much as possible for
    FlightGear.

    * As a bonus, the new Label widget indicates the exit status of the last
    FlightGear run, or the signal number in case the fgfs process was
    terminated by a signal.

    * While FlightGear is running, the "Run FG" button is now greyed out.

[FEATURE] Add preview of FlightGear command. (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Add FlightGear output window and log saving.
          (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Remove everything related to running a standalone TerraSync
          program in the background. As TerraSync has been integrated into
          FlightGear several years ago, this feature was probably more
          confusing than useful to users nowadays. (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Allow the command preview and FG output windows to be detached,
          reattached and hidden. Store their geometry when reattaching,
          closing them or choosing "Save & Quit" to be able to restore it when
          they are later shown again. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Improve initialization of locales and translations at application
          startup. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Change USER_DATA_DIR to ~/.ffgo on Unix, %APPDATA%/FFGo on Windows.
          (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] New dialogs at application startup to offer to copy FGo!'s config
          file to USER_DATA_DIR when this is safe, start with "factory
          defaults", or abort. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Rename the 'fgo' script to 'ffgo' in order to avoid confusing users
          concerning the FGo! program distributed by Robert Leda.
          (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Allow closing the Preferences window with the Escape key.
          (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Rename the 'Reset' button to 'Reload config', which is more
          self-explanatory in my opinion. Add a tooltip to this button that
          indicates the config file path. (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Add menu entries in the File menu to reload the config file and to
          run FlightGear. These entries show the new keyboard shortcuts.
[FEATURE] Help files: update installation instructions, add description of new
          features and add a tip about config file reloading.
          (Robert & Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Add top-level README.rst and move first sections of
          data/help/help_en to it. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Update data/config/config_en: slightly reorder, improve wording
          (IMHO), remove reference to now-invalid URL (list of callsigns in
          use), introduce new options, give hint about
          'fgfs --help --verbose'. (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] New ffgo.svg icon and new thumbnail.jpg (with xcf source).
          (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Add Makefiles to automate generation of many files
          (messages.pot, *.po and *.mo files, ffgo.png in all sizes from
          ffgo.svg, HTML rendering of docs/README.conditional-config.source,
          release tarball...). (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Rename messages.{pot,po,mo} to FFGo.{pot,po,mo}. This will make it
          much easier for downstream distributors to create FHS-compliant
          packages with .mo files in /usr/share/locale/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/
          (which is shared by all programs on a given system, therefore using
          such a generic name as 'messages' is unacceptable there).
          (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Improve the thumbnail situation. cf. the Git log for
          6bf65f453ba28920397371d932b3b2ef491827bc for details (information
          maybe relevant to packagers but not users; in short,
          data/pics/thumbnail.ppm is replaced by
          data/pics/thumbnail-no-Pillow.gif and data/pics/thumbnail.jpg by
          data/pics/thumbnail-not-avail.png, and the two new files are both
          automatically generated from their respective sources).
          ImageMagick's convert program is now required by the Makefiles when
          installing from the Git repository. (Florent Rougon)
[BUGFIX]  Fix a bug introduced in 1.0.0b2 that would prevent FFGo from working
          properly when Pillow is not installed. (Florent Rougon)
[BUGFIX]  Include FFGo.pot in release tarballs. It is not needed by FFGo, but
          may be useful for people wanting to add new translations.
          (Florent Rougon)
[FEATURE] Add Setuptools packaging. This will make it easier (once you have
          learnt how to use pip) to install, upgrade, remove, or check when
          FFGo or one of its dependencies has a newer upstream version. Please
          read docs/INSTALL/INSTALL_en for user-level details and the Git log
          for developer-level details. This change impacts a lot of files.
          The top-level 'src' directory is renamed to 'ffgo' (necessary to be
          able to install FFGo with 'pip install --editable'). The 'data'
          top-level directory is not top-level anymore: moved under the
          top-level 'ffgo' directory. This should improve FFGo's portability
          to non-Linux platforms with a minimum of platform-specific code.
          (Florent Rougon)
[BUGFIX]  Fix missing import for a Windows-specific code path (this prevented
          FFGo from starting under Windows; I hope that is the last remaining
          problem of this kind on Windows. I definitely need testers for this
          platform. Please report on your experiences!). (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Improve tooltips of the Preferences dialog. (Florent Rougon)
[USABILITY] Use CRLF line endings for the top-level README.rst file as well as
            for docs/INSTALL/INSTALL_* because the Windows Notepad program
            used not to be able to read LF line endings (ahem). Is it still
            the case in 2015? These files should be enough to get users
            started. (Florent Rougon)
