        FFGo
        ===============================================================================
        A powerful graphical launcher for FlightGear
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        This software is a fork of the excellent `FGo!`_ program written by
        Robert “erobo” Leda, see HISTORY in the ``docs/README/README_en`` file
        for details. It is a graphical launcher for `FlightGear`_, *i.e.,* a
        program whose purpose is to allow easy assembling and running of an
        ``fgfs`` command line.

        FFGo is written in `Python`_ 3 and is based on `CondConfigParser`_,
        which allows many interesting things as shown at:

           In this first screenshot, the font size is a bit too large to let a
           descent amount of space available for the Command Window (at the
           bottom, in gray). But just as the Output Window, it can be detached
           from the main window: see the next screenshot.

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        FFGo relies on the following software:
        
          - Operating system:
        
              * GNU/Linux surely works, as should any Unix-like system;
              * Windows should work, please report;
              * MacOS X should also work, except maybe for MacOS-specific Tcl/Tk
                bugs as explained at
                `<https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/>`_. Please report.
        
          - `FlightGear`_;
          - `Python`_ 3.4 or later;
          - `Tkinter`_ (part of the Python standard library; often known as
            ``python3-tk`` or ``python-tk`` in Linux package managers);
          - `CondConfigParser`_.
          - `Pillow`_ (a PIL fork that supports Python 3) [#]_;
        
        .. [#] This library is not mandatory to run FFGo, but aircraft thumbnails
               won't be displayed without it.
        
        .. _Tkinter: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
        .. _Pillow: http://python-pillow.github.io/
        
        Note:
        
          The home pages of FFGo's dependencies indicated here are current at
          the time of this writing (August 2015) but might change over time.
        
        
        Download
        --------
        
        Release tarballs or zip files can be downloaded from:
        
          http://people.via.ecp.fr/~flo/projects/FFGo/dist/
        
        
        Git repository
        --------------
        
        FFGo is maintained in a `Git repository
        <https://github.com/frougon/FFGo>`_ that can be cloned with::
        
          git clone https://github.com/frougon/FFGo.git
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The detailed installation guide for FFGo is in the ``docs/INSTALL``
        directory in any release tarball or zip file. In short:
        
          - FFGo may be run without installation, provided that all software
            requirements are installed.
        
          - Otherwise, FFGo can be installed in the standard way for Python
            packages, i.e. with::
        
              pip install FFGo
        
            If you have never used `pip`_ before, or if you need more details,
            read the guide in ``docs/INSTALL`` before running this command, and
            **don't invoke it as the superuser** unless you *really* know what
            you are doing!
        
            Besides FFGo, you may want to also install `Pillow`_ in order to see
            the aircraft thumbnails in FFGo. The presence of Pillow is detected
            at run time, therefore it doesn't matter if Pillow is installed
            before or after FFGo.
        
        .. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        
        
        Running
        -------
        
        - If you chose to run FFGo without installing it:
        
          From your file manager, you may click on the ``ffgo-launcher.py`` file
          in the top-level directory obtained after unpacking a release tarball
          or zip file. Alternatively, you can run it from a terminal with a
          command such as ``./ffgo-launcher.py`` or ``python3
          ffgo-launcher.py``. Just make sure you are running
          ``ffgo-launcher.py`` with the `Python`_ interpreter for which you
          installed the dependencies.
        
        - Otherwise, if you installed FFGo with `pip`_:
        
          pip should have installed an ``ffgo`` executable in the directory it
          normally installs scripts into. This directory may be a ``Scripts``
          subdirectory of your Python installation, or a ``bin`` subdirectory of
          the virtual environment if you ran it in a venv, etc. It depends on
          how you ran pip (inside or outside a venv, etc.). More details are
          given in ``docs/INSTALL``, and if this is not enough, please refer to
          the `pip`_ documentation.
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Apart from this text (which corresponds to ``README.rst`` in a release
        tarball or zip file), FFGo's documentation can be found in the ``docs``
        top-level directory after unpacking a release tarball or zip file. Once
        FFGo is installed, users should start by reading ``docs/README/README_en``
        (``en`` being for the English version; this text is also accessible from
        FFGo's *Help* menu). In a second time,
        ``docs/README.conditional-config`` (`available online
        <http://people.via.ecp.fr/~flo/projects/FFGo/doc/README-conditional-config/>`_)
        explains how to use the full power of the configuration system used by
        FFGo.
        
        If you got FFGo from the `Git repository`_ instead of a release tarball,
        part of the documentation is in source form only (written for
        `Sphinx`_). There is a special section in ``docs/INSTALL`` which
        explains how to build it in this situation [#]_. In any case, this
        documentation (for the latest FFGo release) is always `available online
        <http://people.via.ecp.fr/~flo/projects/FFGo/doc/README-conditional-config/>`_.
        
        .. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
        
        .. [#] Basically, it boils down to installing a recent enough `Sphinx`_
               and running ``make doc`` from the top-level directory.
