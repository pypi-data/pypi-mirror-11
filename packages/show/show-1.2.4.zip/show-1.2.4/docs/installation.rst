Installation
============

To install or upgrade to the latest version::

    pip install -U show

To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.4 in this example)::

    python3.4 -m easy_install --upgrade show

(You may need to prefix these with ``sudo`` to authorize
installation. In environments without super-user privileges, you may want to
use ``pip``'s ``--user`` option, to install only for a single user, rather
than system-wide.)
