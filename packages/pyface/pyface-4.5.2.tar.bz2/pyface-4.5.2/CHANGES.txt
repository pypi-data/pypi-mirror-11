Pyface Changelog
================

Release 4.5.2
———————————

This release includes a large number of additions to the test suite that
provide at least basic smoke-test coverage of the core of the library.  There
has also been work done to improve the continuous integration testing of
the library.  Much more work needs to be done on this front, but the situation
is improving.

The process of adding these tests also discovered a number of minor bugs
which have been fixed.

Finally, this release warns that as of Pyface 5.0 the default GUI toolkit
will switch from Wx to Qt.  This future update will change the behaviour of
the library in the case where both WxPython and PyQt/PySide are installed and
the user or code doesn't specify the toolkit to use explicitly.
