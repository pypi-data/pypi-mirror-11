Python client for Ethereum JSON RPC Server

> Note that this currently only implements a handful of the JSON RPC methods
> exposed by the server.

## Installation

Install with `pip`

```bash
$ pip install ethereum-rpc-client
```

## Basic Usage

Assuming you have an Ethereum node running the JSON RPC server on `localhost:8454`


```python
>>> from eth_rpc_client import Client
>>> client = Client(host="127.0.0.1", port="8454")
>>> client.get_coinbase()
... '0xd3cda913deb6f67967b99d67acdfa1712c293601'
```

## API

### `Client.get_coinbase()`

> https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_coinbase

Returns the hex encoded coinbase.

### `Client.get_gas_price()`

> https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gasprice

Returns the gas price in wei as an integer

### `Client.get_balance(address, block="latest")`

> https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getbalance

* **address**: The hex encoded address to lookup the balance for.
* **block**: The block to use for the lookup.

Returns the account balance for the address in wei as an integer.

### `Client.get_code(address, block="latest")`

> https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getcode

* **address**: The hex encoded address to lookup the code for.
* **block**: The block to use for the lookup.

Returns the code at the given address.

### `Client.call(_from=None, to=None, gas=None, gas_price=None, value=0, data=None, block="latest")`

> https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_call

* **_from**: The hex encoded address to use as the source for the call.
* **to**: The hex encoded address of the contract for the call.
* **gas**: Integer gas alotment for the call.
* **gas_price**: Integer gas price in wei.
* **value**: Integer amount in wei to send with the call.
* **data**: The call data.

Returns the call response.


### `Client.get_transaction_receipt(txn_hash)`

> https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_gettransactionreceipt

* **txn_hash**: The hex encoded transaction hash to lookup.

Returns a dictionary of the transaction receipt or `None` if no receipt is
found.

* **transactionHash**: hex encoded hash of the transaction.
* **transactionIndex**: integer of the transactions index position in the block.
* **blockHash**: hex encoded hash of the block where this transaction was in.
* **blockNumber**: integer block number where this transaction was in.
* **cumulativeGasUsed**: The total amount of gas used when this transaction was executed in the block.
* **gasUsed**: The amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
* **contractAddress**: The contract address created, if the transaction was a contract creation, otherwise null.
* **logs**: list of log objects, which this transaction generated
