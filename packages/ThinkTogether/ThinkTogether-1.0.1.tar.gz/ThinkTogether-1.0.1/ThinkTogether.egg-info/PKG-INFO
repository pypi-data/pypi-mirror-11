Description: 
        ThinkTogether
        -----
        ThinkTogether is a light-weight package that implements classes designed to reimagine modular learning, research, and development-oriented inquiry.  
        ThinkTogether embodies and enforces an information hierarchy that segments analysis cleanly into two parts: gathering and processing.
        
        ThinkingTogether Builds Complex Systems
        ````````````
        ThinkTogether may be imagined as the building blocks of a large-scale research project. The bricks are InformationSets and InferenceSets, and the roof is the Collection, which ties a project together into an easily accessible object. All three classes extend Pythonâ€™s native dictionary class.
        .. code:: python
        	from ThinkTogether import InformationSet, InferenceSet, Collection
