js.d3_tip
*********

Introduction
============

This library packages `d3-tip`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`d3-tip`: http://labratrevenge.com/d3-tip/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.d3_tip``) are published to some URL.
