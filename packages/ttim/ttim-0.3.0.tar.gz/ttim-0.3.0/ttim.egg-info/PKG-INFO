Description: TTim, A Multi-Layer, Transient, Analytic Element Model
        ======================================================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        TTim is a computer program for the modeling of transient multi-layer
        flow with analytic elements and consists of a library of Python scripts
        and FORTRAN extensions. TTim is based on the Laplace-transform analytic
        element method. The solution is computed analytically in the Laplace
        domain and converted back to the time domain numerically usig the
        algorithm of De Hoog, Stokes, and Knight. TTim may be applied to an
        arbitrary number of aquifers and leaky layers. The head, flow, and
        leakage between aquifers may be computed semi-analytically at any point
        in space and time. The design of TTim is object-oriented and has been
        kept simple and flexible. New analytic elements may be added to the code
        without making any changes in the existing part of the code. TTim is
        coded in Python; use is made of FORTRAN extensions to improve
        performance.
        
        TTim Changes
        ------------
        
        Version 0.3
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In version 0.3, the numbering of the layers in TTim has changed. Layers
        are numbered from the top down starting at number 0. (in TTim versions
        prior to 0.3, layer numbers started at 1).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **Python versions:**
        
        TTim requires **Python** 2.7 and can be installed from PyPI. The PyPI
        installation includes compiled versions of the FORTRAN extension for
        both Windows and MaxOS.
        
        **Dependencies:**
        
        TTim requires **NumPy** 1.9 (or higher) and **matplotlib** 1.4 (or
        higher). T
        
        **For base Python distributions:**
        
        To install TTim, open a command prompt and type:
        
        ::
        
            pip install ttim
        
        To update TTim type:
        
        ::
        
            pip install ttim --upgrade
        
        To uninstall TTim type:
        
        ::
        
            pip uninstall ttim
