Description: Findig
        ======
        
        Findig is a micro-framework for developing RESTful Python web applications
        that's built on Werkzeug_.

        Why not just use Flask?
        -----------------------
        
        Flask_ is great; we love it! What we noticed, however, is that it's best
        suited for HTML-based web apps. Findig is an alternative that's tuned for
        building RESTful applications, or APIs.

        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        A RESTful application can be seen as a set of web resources that can be read
        and modified using different HTTP verbs. With Findig, you create your
        application by declaring your resources. The gist is that you provide a
        function that knows how to read the resource data from storage, and optionally
        update it when it changes; Findig handles the REST (yeah, we like puns).
        Of course, most of Findig's guts are easily customizable for when your API
        needs an added layer of complexity.
