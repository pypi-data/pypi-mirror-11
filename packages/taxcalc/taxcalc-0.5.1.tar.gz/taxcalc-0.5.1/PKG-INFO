Description: Tax Calculator
        ==============
        
        The Tax Calculator simulates the US federal individual income tax
        system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the US
        population and a set of behavioral assumptions, the Tax Calculator can
        be used to conduct revenue scoring and distributional analyses of tax
        policies.  The Tax Calculator is written in Python, an interpreted
        language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
        
        About OSPC
        ==========
        
        The Open Source Policy Center (OSPC) seeks to make policy analysis
        more transparent, trustworthy, and collaborative by harnessing
        open-source methods to build cutting-edge economic models.
        
        Disclaimer
        ==========
        
        The Tax Calculator is currently under development.  Users should be
        forewarned that the taxcalc API (application programming interface)
        could change significantly, and the implementation is subject to wild
        change.  Therefore, there is NO GUARANTEE OF ACCURACY. THE CODE SHOULD
        NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH
        PURPOSES.  The source code is currently available for testing purposes
        only.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        At the moment there are two ways to start using the Tax Calculator.
        
        The first way is install the Tax Calculator on your computer.  Do this
        by following the instructions in our [Contributor
        Guide](http://taxcalc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor_guide.html).
        
        The second way is to access the Tax Calculator through our web
        application, [TaxBrain](http://www.ospc.org/).  Do this by emailing
        [Matt Jensen](mailto:matt.jensen@aei.org) about becoming a TaxBrain
        beta tester.
        
        Conda Package for Advanced Anaconda Users
        =========================================
        
        Conda taxcalc packages are created for every release of the Tax
        Calculator.  We use them to install taxcalc on Amazon Web Services
        (AWS) instances that run the TaxBrain web application.  You can get
        the latest release of the taxcalc package to run on your computer via
        the command `conda install -c ospc taxcalc`.  Note that this package
        does not include a micro data set that represents the US population.
