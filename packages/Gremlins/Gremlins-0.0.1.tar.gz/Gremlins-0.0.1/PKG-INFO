Description: Gremlin
        =======
        
        Gremlin is a tool for end-to-end testing of networked systems on a localhost.
        It's intended to make it simple to do basic scripted checks of systems within
        "make check", and is probably less useful for broader tests or experiments
        (ask ygor to do that heavy lifting).
