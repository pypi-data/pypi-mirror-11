-  ``nbgrader assign``: create a student version of a notebook
-  ``nbgrader release``: release a notebook to students
-  ``nbgrader collect``: collect students' submissions
-  ``nbgrader autograde``: autograde students' submissions
-  ``nbgrader formgrade``: launch the formgrader

------------

The nbgrader system and command line tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may install the current version of nbgrader which includes the
