A system for assigning and grading notebooks.

`Documentation can be found on Read the
Docs. <http://nbgrader.readthedocs.org>`__

Installation
------------

If you want to develop on nbgrader, please follow the `development
installation instructions <CONTRIBUTING.md#development-installation>`__.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing nbgrader, please ensure that the IPython notebook is
properly installed. Note that it is not sufficient to just install
IPython; you must specifically install the notebook components as well.

If using conda, run

::

    conda install ipython-notebook=3.2

Otherwise, run

::

    pip install ipython[notebook]==3.2

Installing nbgrader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing the above dependencies, you can install the current
version of nbgrader with:

::

    pip install nbgrader

You can then install and activate the nbgrader assignment toolbar
extension with:

::

    nbgrader extension install
    nbgrader extension activate

If you want to install the extension for only yourself (and not
systemwide), use ``nbgrader extension install --user``. If you don't
want to have to reinstall the extension when nbgrader is updated, use
``nbgrader extension install --symlink``. To get help and see all the
options you can pass while installing/activating the nbgrader notebook
extension, use:

::

    nbgrader extension install --help-all
    nbgrader extension activate --help-all
