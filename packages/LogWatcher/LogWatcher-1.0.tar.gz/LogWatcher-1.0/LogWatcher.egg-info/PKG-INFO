        Description
        ===========
        
        LogWatcher is a daemon that gathers metrics from the access logs of web applications, and provides them to Ganglia in near-realtime. Metrics are named with the prefix "LW_" for easy identification. An instance of LogWatcher is required for each access log that is to be watched. The log file can be either statically named or pre-rotated with timestamp in the filename. Metrics are typically collected/averaged by minute, but this is configurable.
