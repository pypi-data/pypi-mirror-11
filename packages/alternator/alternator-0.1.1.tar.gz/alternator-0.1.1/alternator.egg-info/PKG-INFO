        Alternator provides tools to ease the creation of `asynchronous generators`__.

        Synchronous generators are pretty easy to create and manipulate in Python.  In
        Python 3.5 asynchronous generators are possible.  Consuming them with ``async
        for`` is pretty nice, but creating them is a fairly manual process.
        
        Maybe a future version of Python will correct this imbalance.
        
        Or maybe we can fix it with TOOLS!
