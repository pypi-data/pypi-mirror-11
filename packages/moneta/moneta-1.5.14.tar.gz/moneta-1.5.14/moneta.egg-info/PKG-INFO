Description: Moneta
        ======
        
        Moneta is a web application emulating different kinds of package repositories.
        The goal is not to replace official mirrors like packages.debian.org or mirror.centos.org, but to have a single location
        for all your Python/Java/Debian/RedHat private packages.
        
        Repositories are created on-the-fly and you can limit upload rights to some groups of users.
        
        Currently, you can create the following types of repositories:
        
            * Aptitude for Ubuntu or Debian systems,
            * Yum for CentOS, Fedora or Red Hat systems,
            * Maven for Java or Scala packages,
            * Pypi for Python packages,
            * any binary, versionned files.
        
        You can read more docs at http://moneta.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html .
        
        
        In the future, I would like to add the following kinds of repositories:
        
            * Jetbrains for IntelliJ/PyCharm/PhpStor/Clion plugins,
            * brew (packaging system for OS X),
            * CPAN for Perl,
            * LaTeX,
            * Gem for Ruby,
            * PHP,
            * JS.
