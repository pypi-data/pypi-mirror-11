Description: Generic schedulers for competitions
        ===================================
        
        The goal of this package is to provide high-quality, randomized schedule
        generators for competitions, particularly leagues. The schedulers generate
        lists of rounds for competitions when provided a list of teams or a team count.
        
        Right now, this library supports schedule generation for pure round-robin
        competitions with even numbers of meetings. While special wrappers are provided
        for double and quadruple round-robin leagues, competitions with more meetings
        are possible. Be warned that these higher-level schedules are not tested.
