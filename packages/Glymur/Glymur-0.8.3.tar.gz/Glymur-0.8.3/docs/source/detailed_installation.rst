Glymur Configuration
''''''''''''''''''''''

The default glymur installation process relies upon OpenJPEG being
properly installed on your system as a shared library. If you have
OpenJPEG installed through your system’s package manager on linux, Cygwin,
or if you use MacPorts on the mac, you are probably already set to
go. But if you have OpenJPEG installed into a non-standard place
or if you use windows, then read on.

Glymur uses ctypes to access the openjp2/openjpeg libraries, and
because ctypes accesses libraries in a platform-dependent manner,
it is recommended that **if** you compile and install OpenJPEG into a
non-standard location, you should then create a configuration file
to help Glymur properly find the openjpeg or openjp2 libraries The
configuration format is the same as used by Python’s configparser
module, i.e. ::

    [library]
    openjp2: /somewhere/lib/libopenjp2.so

This assumes, of course, that you've installed OpenJPEG into
/opt/openjpeg on a linux system.  The location of the configuration file
can vary as well.  If you use either linux or mac, the path
to the configuration file would normally be ::

    $HOME/.config/glymur/glymurrc 

but if you have the **XDG_CONFIG_HOME** environment variable defined,
the path will be ::

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/glymur/glymurrc 

On windows, the path to the configuration file can be determined by starting
up Python and typing ::

    import os
    os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'glymur', 'glymurrc')

You may also include a line for the version 1.x openjpeg library if you have it
installed in a non-standard place, i.e. ::

    [library]
    openjpeg: /somewhere/lib/libopenjpeg.so

Once again, you should not have to bother with a configuration file if you use
mac, linux, or Cygwin, and OpenJPEG is provided by your package manager.

'''''''
Testing
'''''''

It is not necessary, but you may wish to download OpenJPEG's test
data for the purpose of configuring and running OpenJPEG's test
suite.  Check their instructions on how to do that.  You can then
set the **OPJ_DATA_ROOT** environment variable for the purpose of
pointing Glymur to OpenJPEG's test suite. ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data.git
    $ export OPJ_DATA_ROOT=`pwd`/openjpeg-data

In order to run the tests, you can either run them from within
python as follows ... ::

    >>> import glymur
    >>> glymur.runtests()

or from the command line. ::

    $ cd /to/where/you/unpacked/glymur
    $ python -m unittest discover
