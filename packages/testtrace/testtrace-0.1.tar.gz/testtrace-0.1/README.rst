testtrace -- trace your tests
=============================

This module implements the idea that one can see what code each particular test
case executes and then use that information to do something useful and
interesting.

The module provides the building blocks but doesn't handle useful things like
parsing the source python to determine which class/function/test is where. That
can be done by other layers (though contributions are welcome!)

See the associated demo.py script for details.
