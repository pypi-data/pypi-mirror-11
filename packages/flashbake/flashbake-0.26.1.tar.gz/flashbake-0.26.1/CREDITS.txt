First and foremost, I want to thank Cory Doctorow.  His simple inquiries into
using source control for his writing projects served as the original genesis
of this project.

I also want to thank all of the early adopters who helped improve the code and
the documentation by simply asking questions and using the software.

To date, I've also had a few contributors who have helped by submitting patches
and working directly on the project:
* Vaskin Kissoyan - docs, testing
* Ben Snider, bensnider.com - the original code for microblogs.py, docs
* garthrk, github.org/garthrk - random fixes and tests, docs
* Jason Penney, jasonpenney.net - brain storming, random fixes and enhancements
* Tony Giunta - alternate implementation of uptime that uses uptime command

I want to give a special thanks to Jonathan Coulton, Brad Turcotte and Beatnik
Turtle for freely offering their songs for download.  Being able to grab a
handful of tracks and import them into Banshee let me build that plugin very
quickly, whislt listening to their awesome tunes to boot.
