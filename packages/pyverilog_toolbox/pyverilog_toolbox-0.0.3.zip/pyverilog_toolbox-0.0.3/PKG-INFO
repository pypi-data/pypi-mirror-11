Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Pyverilog\_toolbox is Pyverilog-based verification/design tool including
        code clone finder, metrics calculator and so on. Pyverilog\_toolbox
        accerating your digital circuit design verification. Thanks to Pyverilog
        developer shtaxxx.
        
        Software Requirements
        =====================
        
        -  Python (2.7)
        -  Pyverilog (you can download from
           https://github.com/shtaxxx/Pyverilog) Pyverilog requires Icarus
           verilog
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you want to use Pyverilog as a general library, you can install on
        your environment by using setup.py.
        
        If you use Python 2.7,
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Or you can use pip
        
        ::
        
            pip install pyverilog_toolbox
        
        Python 3.x is not tried by author.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        codeclone\_finder
        -----------------
        
        codeclone\_finder can find pair of the register clone, which always hold
        same value. Also can find pair of the invert register, which always hold
        different value.

        combloop\_finder
        ----------------
        
        Combinational logic loop is sticky problem, but you can find it by
        combloop\_finder easily.
        
        `Click here to know
        usage <https://github.com/fukatani/Pyverilog_toolbox/blob/master/pyverilog_toolbox/docs/combloop.md>`__
        
        unreferenced\_finder
        --------------------
        
        Unreferenced\_finder can find signals which isn't referenced by any
        signals. By using this, you can delte unnecessary codes.

        metrics\_calculator
        -------------------
        
        metrics\_analyzer is metrics measurment tools for Verilog HDL. You can
        visualize complecity of module/register/function/.

        usage <https://github.com/fukatani/Pyverilog_toolbox/blob/master/pyverilog_toolbox/docs/metrics.md>`__
        
        regmap\_analyzer
        ----------------
        
        regmap\_analyzer can analyze register map structure from RTL.

        usage <https://github.com/fukatani/Pyverilog_toolbox/blob/master/pyverilog_toolbox/docs/regmap.md>`__
        
        cnt\_analyzer
        -------------
        
        cnt\_analyzer analyze counter property(up or down, max value, reset
        value and counter dependency). And extracting event which depends on
        counter value. This feature help you finding redundunt counter, deadlock
        loop, and other counter trouble.
