python-afl (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename afl.start() as afl.init(), for consistency with AFL >= 1.89b.
    The old name is still available, but it's deprecated.
  * Add new interface for persistent mode, afl.loop().
    Remove the old interface, afl.persistent().
  * Improve the test suite.

python-afl (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implement persistent mode.
  * Add docstrings for the exported functions.
  * Add __version__.
  * Don't rely on the Python hash() function for computing code location
    identifiers.
    + Don't set PYTHONHASHSEED in py-afl-fuzz.
    + Remove the py-afl-showmap command.
      afl-showmap proper can be now used for Python code.
    + Remove the AflError class. It was only used for checking PYTHONHASHSEED.
  * Improve the setup script:
    + Run Cython only in those setup.py commands that actually build extensions.
    + Check Cython version.
  * Implement a small test suite.

python-afl (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automatically disable instrumentation when the -n option is provided.

    Thanks to Michal Zalewski for the hint how to implement this feature.
  * Update the module description to stress that it's dedicated for
    pure-Python code.
