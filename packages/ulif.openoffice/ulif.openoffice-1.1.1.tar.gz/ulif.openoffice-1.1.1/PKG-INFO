        This package provides tools like WSGI apps, cache managers, and
        commandline converters to ease access to LibreOffice/OpenOffice
        installations for Python programmers. Beside basic converting it
        provides 'document processors' for further finetuning of generated
        docs (mainly HTML).
        
        Out of the box these processors allow extracting CSS from HTML
        conversions, removal of LibreOffice-specific tags, zipping, unzipping,
        etc.
        
        If the given processors are not enough for you, or you want some
        special handling of results (say, sign generated docs
        cryptographically, add watermarks, or whatever), you can define own
        additional document processors in your own packages by using the
        Python entry-point API. `ulif.openoffice` will integrate them
        automatically during document processing and provide them in
        webservices, commandline clients and Python API.
        
        .. note:: `ulif.openoffice` trusts `unoconv` to do the actual
                  conversions. So you must have the `unoconv` script installed
                  on your system.

        Examples
        ========
        
        Conversion via Python
        ---------------------
        
        A .doc to .html conversion via the Python API can be done like this::
        
            >>> from ulif.openoffice.client import Client
            >>> client = Client()
            >>> result = client.convert('document.doc')
            >>> pprint(result)
            ('.../document.html.zip', None, {'error': False, 'oocp_status': 0})
        
        ..
            >>> doctest_rm_resultdir(result[0])         # clean up
        
        The generated document is by default brushed up HTML with separate
        stylesheets and images all put into a single .zip document.
        
        You can configure the document conversion via various options. This
        way you can set the output type (at least PDF, HTML, XHTML and TXT are
        supported), tell whether separate CSS stylesheets should be extracted,
        which PDF format should be generated (1.3 aka PDF/A or 1.4), and many,
        many things more.
        
        Conversion via Commandline
        --------------------------
        
        We also provide a handy commandline tool to perform conversions::
        
            $ oooclient document.doc
            RESULT in /tmp/.../document.html.zip
        
        As you can see, the result is put in a freshly created directory.
        
        The commandline client also provides help to display all supported
        options, document processors, etc.::
        
            $ oooclient --help
        
        will give you the comprehensive list.
        
        
        Conversion via Web (XMLRPC or RESTful)
        --------------------------------------
        
        `ulif.openoffice` comes with two WSGI applications that provide
        document conversion services to web clients. One is a RESTful document
        conversion service, the other is a WSGI based XMLRPC server. With one
        of these applications running you can send office documents to a
        server and will receive the converted document.
        
        All WSGI document converters supports (optional) local caching which
        will store conversion results and deliver it (bypassing new
        conversion) if a document was requested to be converted already.
        
        The package comes with prepared configuration files to setup and start
        such a web-based document converter in minutes.
        
        See the extended docs under
        
          https://ulif-openoffice.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        for details.
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        User Install
        ------------
        
        `ulif.openoffice` can be installed via `pip`::
        
            $ pip install ulif.openoffice
        
        Afterwards all commandline tools should be available.
        
        
        Developer Install
        -----------------
        
        It is recommended to setup sources in a virtual environment::
        
            $ virtualenv py27      # Python 2.6, 2.7 are supported
            $ source py27/bin/activate
            (py27) $
        
        Get the sources::
        
            (py27) $ git clone https://github.com/ulif/ulif.openoffice.git
            (py27) $ cd ulif.openoffice
        
        Install packages for testing::
        
            (py27) $ python setup.py dev
        
        It is recommended to start the ``oooctl`` daemon before running
        tests::
        
            (py27) $ oooctl start
        
        This will make LibreOffice listen in background and reduce
        runtime of tests significantly.
        
        Running tests::
        
            (py27) $ py.test
        
        We also support `tox` to run tests for all supported Python versions::
        
            (py27) $ pip install tox
            (py27) $ tox
        
        Of course you must have the respective Python versions installed
        (currently: Python 2.6, 2.7).
        
        Running coverage detector::
        
            (py27) $ py.test --cov=ulif.openoffice    # for cmdline results
            (py27) $ py.test --cov=ulif.openoffice --cov-report=html
        
        The latter will generate HTML coverage reports in a subdirectory.
        
        Install packages for Sphinx-base documentation::
        
            (py27) $ python setup.py docs
            (py27) $ cd doc
            (py27) $ make html
        
        Will generate the documentation in a subdirectory.

        CHANGES
        *******
        
        1.1.1 (2015-07-23)
        ==================
        
        * Close file handles properly.
        
        * The commandline client now only handles one input file and does not
          copy whole directory contents any more.
        
        
        1.1 (2015-07-12)
        ================
        
        * Added a WSGI-based XMLRPC application to trigger conversion via
          XMLRPC.
        
        * Added `get_cached` method for client and XMLRPC client to retrieve
          docs stored in cache.
        
        * Added `get_cached_file_by_source` method for cachemanager. This method
          is expensive but allows finding cached files without a cache key.
        
        * Fixed bug: OOCP processor returned wrong result file path for XHTML
          output.
        
        * Fixed bug: Remove temporary dir if converting fails in client.
        
        * Modified tests to accept also docs generated on Ubuntu 14.04.
        
        * Fixed bug: Catch shutil.Error in copytree() [thanks to: sbywater]
        
        * Added new option: `--css-cleaner-prettify-html` prettifies generated
          HTML code. This was done automatically  in previous releases and can
          lead to gaps in rendered output. This option, when set (disabled by
          default) enables the old behaviour. Fixes #3.
        
        
        1.0 (2013-09-02)
        ================
        
        Major rewrite of the whole package.
        
        * `convert` now uses the commandline tool `unoconv`. You need this
          tool to use the package.
        
        * As `unoconv` has all you want from the package script `convert` (and
          much more!), the `convert` script is not provided as a script any
          more. Simply use `unoconv` instead.
        
        * `oooctl` is now a daemonizer for ``unoconv -l``.
        
        * Apply PEP 8 rules to cachemanager.py.
        
        * Moved unittests to dedicated ``tests/`` dir in package root.
        
        * Switched from Zope testing to `py.test`.
        
        * Removed `pyuno` server, clients and related components.
        
        * Removed `find` functionality as it is based on direct `pyuno` access.
        
        * Removed `zc.buildout` support.
        
        * Removed cherrypy-based restserver. The new WSGI app is the replacement.
        
        * Added WSGI based document converter.
        
        * Added simple htaccess WSGI filter for web authentication.
        
        * Replaced cachemanager with a more robust and lightweight
          version. Old caches do not work any more with this new
          implementation.
        
        * Introduced a new central `Options` component to manage supported
          options for all other components.
        
        0.4 (2011-02-11)
        ================
        
        * Added functionality to find text in documents. Many thanks to sig at
          akasig.org for the patch!
        
        0.3 (2010-11-17)
        ================
        
        * Added option to disable caching completely: set ``--cache-dir`` to
          empty string to disable caching [Thanks to Adama Groszer for
          patches!]
        
        * Removed unwanted output when running in foreground mode.
        
        * Cachemanager now supports listing all sources contained in cache
          dir.
        
        * Fixed bug in cachemanager: under rare circumstances (two different
          input files with same MD5 hash digest *and* identical file stats
          were considered to be identical by the cachemanager and thus led to
          inconsistencies in cache). We now check thoroughly whether two such
          files differ.
        
        * Lots of test fixes [Thanks to Adam Groszer for patches!]
        
        0.2.1 (2010-06-13)
        ==================
        
        * Fixed fix to cope with pyuno monkey-patching standard __import__
          function. More recent pyuno versions do not do that kind of stuff
          any more (which is an improvement).
        
        * Fixed foreground start of ```oooctl``` server. It didn't work
          correctly with more recent OpenOffice.org/pyuno installs. You now
          don't have to press CTRL-C two times anymore when trying to stop a
          oooctl server running in foreground.
        
        
        0.2 (2010-05-20)
        ================
        
        * Added license and copyright file to comply with policy of major
          Linux distributors.
        
        * Added sphinx docs.
        
        * Fixed wrong result path when returning cached HTML results.
        
        * Added mode ``fg`` for ``oooctl``. Using ``oooctl fg`` one can start
          ``oooctl`` in foreground now.
        
        * Added mode ``fg`` for ``pyunoctl``. Using ``pyunoctl fg`` one can start
          ``pyunoctl`` in foreground now.
        
        * Added state check for ``oooctl``: when OpenOffice.org server is down
          during runtime it is restarted automatically. The check happens
          every second.
        
        * Use standard lib `doctest` instead of `zope.testing.doctest`.
        
        * Changed PDF creation: by default now normal PDF (and not PDF/A) is
          created when converting to PDF. This is due to an endianess bug in
          many recent OpenOffice.org binaries running on 64-bit platforms.
        
        0.1 (2010-03-02)
        ================
        
        * Initial implementation.
