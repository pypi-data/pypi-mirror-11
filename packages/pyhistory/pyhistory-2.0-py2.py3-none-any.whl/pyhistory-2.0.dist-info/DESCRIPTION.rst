History directory
-----------------

PyHistory maintains history entries in distributed work environment, which
allows many developers to add/remove history entries between releases without
conflicts.

Features

(All commands can start either with `pyhistory` or shortcut - `pyhi`.)

* Add history entry:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pyhi add 'New feature'
    $ pyhi add Something

* List history entries:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pyhi list

    * New feature
    * Something

* Update your history file with entries for given release:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cat HISTORY.rst
    my project

    * Another one

* Clear all history:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pyhi clear
    Do you really want to remove all entries? [y/N]: y

  Or without prompt:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pyhi clear --yes

Config file
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can adjust Pyhistory behaviour to your needs by ``setup.cfg`` file. Just
put ``pyhistory`` section in there:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pyhistory]
  history_dir = some_dir  # 'history' by default
  history_file = myhistory.rst  # 'HISTORY.rst' by default
  at_line = 42  # by default history will be injected after first headline
