        kraken is a fork of ocropus intended to rectify a number of issues while
        preserving (mostly) functional equivalence. Its main goals are:
        
          - Explicit input/output handling ✓
          - Clean public API 
          - Word bounding boxes in hOCR ✓
          - Tests
          - Removal of runtime dependency on gcc ✓
          - Removal of unused spaghetti code ✓
        
        Ticked of goals have been realized while some others still require further
        work. Pull requests and code contributions are always welcome.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        While kraken does not require a working C compiler on run-time anymore numpy
        and scipy compilation still requires build-essential or your distributions
        equivalent. Because the build behavior of pip versions older than 6.1.0
        interferes with the scipy build process numpy has to be installed before doing
        the actual install:
        
        ::
        
          # pip install numpy
        
        Install kraken either from pypi:
        
        ::
        
          $ pip install kraken
        
        or by running pip in the git repository:
        
        ::
        
          $ pip install .
        
        Finally you'll have to scrounge up an RNN to do the actual recognition of
        characters. To download ocropus' default RNN and place it in the kraken
        directory for the current user:
        
        ::
        
          $ kraken download
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        To binarize a single image using the nlbin algorithm:
        
        ::
        
          $ kraken binarize grey.png bw.png
        
        To segment a binarized image into reading-order sorted lines:
        
        ::
        
          $ kraken segment bw.png lines.txt
        
        To OCR a binarized image using the default RNN and the previously generated
        page segmentation:
        
        ::
        
          $ kraken ocr --lines lines.txt bw.png
