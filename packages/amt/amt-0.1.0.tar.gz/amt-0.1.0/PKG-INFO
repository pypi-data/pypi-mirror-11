        Background
        ----------
        
        AMT is a light weight hardware control interface put into some Intel
        based laptops and desktops as a tool for corporate fleets to manage
        hardware. It provides the basics of power control, as well as remote
        console via VNC. It functions by having a dedicated service processor
        sniff traffic off the network card on specific ports before it gets to
        the operating system. Some versions of Intel NUC boxes have AMT, which
        make them ideal candidates for building a reasonable cluster in your
        basement.
        
        There was once a tool called ``amttool`` which let you interact with
        these systems from Linux. This used the SOAP interface to AMT. That
        was removed in v9 of the firmware, which means it no longer works with
        modern AMT in the field.
        
        The interface that remains is CIM, a standard from the DMTF that
        builds XML models for all the things. There exist very few examples
        for how to make this work on the internet, with one exception: the
        OpenStack Baremetal (Ironic) service. It has native support for AMT hardware
        control.
        
        This project is derivative work from Ironic. The heavy lifting of
        understanding all the CIM magic incantations, and oh the magic they
        are, comes from that code. Refactored for a more minimal usage.
