PyFac version 1.0.0
===================

This is a module and command-line utility for factoring integers.  As a module, we provide a primality test, several functions for extracting a non-trivial factor of an integer, and a generator that yields all of a number's prime factors (with multiplicity).  As a command-line utility, this project aims to replace GNU's ``factor`` command with a more versatile utility --- in particular, this utility can operate on arbitrarily large numbers, uses multiple cores in parallel, uses better algorithms, handles input in reverse Polish notation, and can be tweaked via command-line flags.
