        collective.normalize_buildout
        =============================
        
        Do you have multiple buildouts and you want an easy way to apply new best practices to each buildout in a simple way, but you cannot, because every buildout file is configured slightly different?
        
        Then this package is for you. The normalize_buildout is a script that will normalize your buildout file.
        
        The tool sorts sections and the keys in each section alphabetically, also some special multi line values, like eggs.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        normalize_buildout by default will replace the given config file in place.
        It has a command line option for not changing the file and only reporting via exit code if the file is not normalized. This can easily be integrated in check tools or ci tools.
        
        The script understands the special meaning of some sections and keys:
        
          - buildout section is always the first
          - versions section is always the last
          - recipe key is always first
          - eggs, and zcml values get sorted.
          - keys of sources entries get sorted, values get indented so that branch settings are all on the same column.
        
        Comments above sections and above keys get shuffled together with key or section.
        You can document why you need to pin a specific version of a package and after normalization, the comment is still above the right version specifier.
        - Can be bullet points
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
