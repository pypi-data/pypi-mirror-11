## Does a duck's quack echo?

From the [wikipedia article on echos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo#Duck.27s_quack): 

"A duck's quack doesn't echo" is a much-quoted scientific myth. The truth is that a duck's quack does, in fact, echo;
however, it may be difficult to hear. 

This myth was first debunked by the Acoustics Research Centre at the University of Salford in 2003 as part of the
British Association's Festival of Science. It was also featured in one of the earlier episodes of the popular
Discovery Channel television show MythBusters. The actual reason for the myth is that a quack is a quiet 
and fading sound which produces faint echoes. The myth inspired the title of the British Sky1 TV 
show "Duck Quacks Don't Echo".
