2.0b2 (2015-09-15)
==================

- Introduce scheduler and rework the main backup command. The backy
  command is now only responsible for dealing with individual backups.

  It does no longer care about scheduling.

  A new daemon and a central configuration file is responsible for that
  now. However, it simply calls out to the existing backy command
  so we can still manually interact with the system even if we do not
  use the daemon.

- Add consul integration for backing up Flying Circus root disk images
  with clean snapshots (by asking fc.qemu to use fs-freeze before preparing
  a Ceph snapshot).

- Switch to shorter UUIDs. Existing files with old UUIDs are compatible.

- Turn the configuration format into YAML. Old files are still compatible.
  New configs will be generated as YAML.

- Performance: defrag all new files automatically to avoid btrfs degrading
  extent performance. It appears this doesn't completely duplicate all CoW
  data. Will have to monitor this in the future.

2.0b1 (2014-07-07)
==================

- Clean up docs.

- Add classifiers in setup.py.

- More or less complete rewrite expecting a copy-on-write filesystem as the
  target.

- Flexible backup scheduling using free-form tags.

- Compatible with Python 3.2-3.4.

- Initial open source import as provided by Daniel Kraft (D9T).
