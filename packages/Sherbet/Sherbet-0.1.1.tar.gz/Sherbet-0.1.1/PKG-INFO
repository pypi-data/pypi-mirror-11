Description: The library is a superset for curly braces formatting. Any format suitable for str.format also works for sherbet. Additionally the library supports automatic plural froms. For example string "{x} file{x_plural} {x_plural<are|is>} here." is formatted to "1 file is here." if x is 1 and to "5 files are here" if x is 5. Currently only english is supported.
