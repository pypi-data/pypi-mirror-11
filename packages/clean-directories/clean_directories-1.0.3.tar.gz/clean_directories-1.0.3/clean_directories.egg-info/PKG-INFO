        ## Objective
        
        The python script "clean" allow the user to clean directory off temporary files with its default behavior.
        With anoter configuration, it can allow you to clean a working directory before committing.
        
        The final goal is to provide multiple configurations to clean a directory the exact way you want it.
        
        ## Suggestion
        
        The best way to use this script at its fullest is to place clean.py in a personnal bin directory.
        For example, you can create a directory "bin" in your home and add it to the variable $PATH.
        Then, place the binaries and script you want to execute them wherever you are.
        You can of course rename clean.py to clean or another name you prefer.
