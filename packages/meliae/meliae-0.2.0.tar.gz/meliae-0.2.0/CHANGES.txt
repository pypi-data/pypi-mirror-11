Meliae 0.2.0
############

:0.2.0: 2010-01-08

A fairly major reworking of the internals, provides significant memory
savings and easier navigation of the object graph.


New Features
************

* The loader internals have been rewritten significantly. Instead of
  storing a bunch of objects in a regular python dict, they are now
  stored in a custom Pyrex collection, and proxy objects are created on
  demand.  This means significantly improved memory usage. (roughly
  2:1). (John Arbash Meinel)

* The internals change also changes the interface a bit. When viewing
  an object, a shorter display is given. One can use ``obj[offset]`` to
  get the object at that reference, rather than the reference itself.
  (so fewer indirections through the ObjManager). (John Arbash Meinel)

* Now supports the ``__sizeof__`` interface introduced in python 2.6.
  This allows a class (especially extension classes) to inform
  Meliae/Python how many bytes it is consuming in memory.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Memory objects now use a ``.children`` and ``.parents`` notation,
  rather than ``.ref_list`` and ``.referrers``. For one, this makes it
  clearer as 'referred to' and 'referred from' is a bit tricky. We also
  now have ``.c`` and ``.p`` which return a list of Memory objects,
  rather than just a list of addresses. This makes it very quick to
  move around. Especially with ``.refs_as_dict`` and other such
  niceties. (John Arbash Meinel)
