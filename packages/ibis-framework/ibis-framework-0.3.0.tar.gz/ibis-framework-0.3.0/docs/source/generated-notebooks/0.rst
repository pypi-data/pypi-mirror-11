Intro and Setup
===============

Getting started
===============

You're going to want to make sure you can connect to your Impala
cluster:

.. code:: python

    import ibis
    import os
    ic = ibis.impala_connect(host='quickstart.cloudera')
    ic




.. parsed-literal::

    <ibis.client.ImpalaConnection at 0x7f78b064b190>



Obviously, substitute the parameters that are appropriate for your
environment (see docstring for ``ibis.impala_connect``).
``impala_connect`` uses the same parameters as Impyla's
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/impyla) DBAPI interface

If you have WebHDFS available, connect to HDFS with according to your
WebHDFS config. For kerberized or more complex HDFS clusters please look
at http://hdfscli.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for info on connecting. You
can use a connection from that library instead of using ``hdfs_connect``

.. code:: python

    hdfs_port = os.environ.get('IBIS_WEBHDFS_PORT', 50070)
    hdfs = ibis.hdfs_connect(host='quickstart.cloudera', port=hdfs_port)

Finally, create the Ibis client

.. code:: python

    con = ibis.make_client(ic, hdfs_client=hdfs)
    con




.. parsed-literal::

    <ibis.client.ImpalaClient at 0x7f78b064b7d0>
