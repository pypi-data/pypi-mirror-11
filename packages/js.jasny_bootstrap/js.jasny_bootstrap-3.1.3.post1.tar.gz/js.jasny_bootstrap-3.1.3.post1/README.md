Introduction
============

This library packages `Jasny Bootstrap`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Jasny Bootstrap`: http://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jasny_bootstrap``) are published to some URL.
