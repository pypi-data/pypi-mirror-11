Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Jasny Bootstrap`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Jasny Bootstrap`: http://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jasny_bootstrap``) are published to some URL.
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``jasny_bootstrap`` from ``js.jasny_bootstrap`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jasny_bootstrap import jasny_bootstrap
          >>> jasny_bootstrap.need()
