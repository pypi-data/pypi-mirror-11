Releases
========

First, get everything you want into master.

This should include changes to ``README.rst`` and ``HISTORY.rst``!

Then, change the version in ``hexes/__init__.py``. Commit that, push it.

Make a release on GitHub, generating the tag. Our tags begin with ``v``.

Run ``make release``.

Dance!
